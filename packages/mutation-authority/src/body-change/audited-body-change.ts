/**
 * Audited body-change syscall — wraps `authorizeBodyChange` with a
 * hash-chained, append-only audit emission so EVERY self-change decision
 * (allow OR deny) lands in the sovereign-class ledger.
 *
 * This enforces the meta-rail's accountability clause (the antidote to
 * the 2025-AI-Agent-Index "accountability diffusion" finding): a
 * body-change is sovereign-class and MUST leave a hash-chained record.
 * The audit emission happens for BOTH outcomes — a denied / fail-closed
 * change is exactly the record an auditor most needs.
 *
 * Pure relative to its ports: the chain primitives come from
 * `@bossnyumba/audit-hash-chain` (no I/O); the caller persists the returned
 * chain. The audit step NEVER suppresses or downgrades the verdict — if
 * the audit emission itself throws, the syscall FAILS CLOSED (a change
 * that cannot be audited must not proceed).
