/**
 * Groundedness scorer — BLACKBOARD-INTEL.
 *
 * A post is "grounded" to the degree its cited evidence resolves
 * through the BLACKBOARD-CORE port. We map:
 *
 *   - 0 citations → score 0 (unsupported claim)
 *   - n citations of which r resolve → score = r / n in [0, 1]
 *
 * Pure function once the resolved-set is supplied. The orchestrator
 * (`post-measurer.ts`) resolves the set via `BlackboardCorePort` and
 * passes the count in.
