/**
 * Closed-Loop Process Layer — Shared types.
 *
 * Every key BossNyumba operation runs inside a closed loop:
 *
 *   observe -> decide -> act -> measure -> adjust
 *
 * Each tick is one revolution. The tick is persisted to
 * `closed_loop_ticks` and the loop's running state lives in
 * `closed_loops`. Adjustments produced during `adjust()` land in
 * `closed_loop_adjustments` so the auditor can read the loop's history
 * (when did it tighten a threshold, why, what data drove the choice).
 *
 * The pattern is intentionally minimal: a `ClosedLoop` is a record of
 * five pure functions. The runtime threads context, persists rows, and
 * enforces the hard rules (tier-policy on act, DecisionTrace on
 * decide, AbortController budget). Loop authors only think about the
 * five steps.
 *
