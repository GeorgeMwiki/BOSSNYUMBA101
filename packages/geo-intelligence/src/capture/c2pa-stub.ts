/**
 * Lightweight C2PA-style signature stub for field captures.
 *
 * The full C2PA implementation lives in
 * `packages/content-studio/src/c2pa/`. That implementation depends on a
 * KMS signer and isn't appropriate to import into the mobile capture
 * path, which runs offline and signs on-device.
 *
 * Here we produce a deterministic SHA-256 over the capture payload and
 * label it as a C2PA "claim signature placeholder". Roundtrip:
 *
 *   sign({ kind:'photo', captureId, capturedAt, location, surveyorId,
 *          payloadHashHex })  ->  signatureHex
 *   verify(payload, signatureHex) -> boolean
 *
 * This isn't legally meaningful provenance — production deployments
 * MUST swap in the content-studio signer (or Truepic / Adobe CA SDK)
 * before relying on this signature for anything beyond UI demos.
