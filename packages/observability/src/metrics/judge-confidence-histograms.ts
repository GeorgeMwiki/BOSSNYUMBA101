/**
 * Judge-score + confidence histogram registration (D6).
 *
 * Exposes two OTel histograms keyed off the global meter so all
 * services that emit judge / confidence telemetry can route through a
 * single registry. The histograms are 0..1 valued (matching how the
 * judge and the confidence scorer normalise their outputs) and use
 * fixed quality-tier buckets so Grafana panels can render the same
 * shape regardless of which service produced the sample.
 *
 *   - `judge_score_seconds`        — buckets 0.1 / 0.25 / 0.5 / 0.75 / 0.9
 *   - `confidence_overall_seconds` — same bucket layout
 *
 * Naming note: we keep the `_seconds` suffix per Prometheus
 * convention for histogram base names so the `_bucket`, `_sum`, and
 * `_count` time-series sit in the obvious place when scraped. The
 * "unit" is a normalised 0..1 score, NOT seconds — the suffix is
 * cosmetic and matches the established BOSSNYUMBA convention for
 * histogram metric names.
