/**
 * DecisionTrace types — ported from LITFIN observability.
 *
 * A DecisionTrace is the unit-of-explanation a human auditor cares about:
 *   "Why did the brain refuse to draft this lease?"
 *   "Why was this payout flagged?"
 *
 * It sits ON TOP of raw OTel spans + Langfuse traces. A trace captures:
 *   - inputs the decision saw
 *   - the alternative BRANCHES considered (with rationale each)
 *   - which branch was CHOSEN (and why)
 *   - the final OUTPUT and outcome
 *
 * Compared to a flat list of "stage" events from the brain kernel's
 * 13-step pipeline, this gives auditors / debug UIs a structured
 * narrative — they can replay a decision and immediately see the
 * counterfactual ("what if the brain had picked branch B instead?").
 *
 * Design constraints (locked by tests):
 *   1. Once `finalize()` is called the snapshot is FROZEN. Any attempt
 *      to mutate via the live handle throws.
 *   2. JSON-serializable end-to-end — `structuredClone(snapshot)` must
 *      succeed so traces can be persisted to Postgres / pushed to
 *      Langfuse / posted to a debug UI without bespoke serialisers.
 *   3. OTel-agnostic — if `@opentelemetry/api` is not resolvable the
 *      otel-bridge is a no-op. Decision logic NEVER breaks because OTel
 *      misbehaved.
 *   4. No-decision is a valid decision — `finalize()` with zero branches
 *      is allowed (e.g. brain decided the input was malformed and bailed
 *      before considering options).
 *

/**
 * One alternative branch the decision considered. Branches are recorded
 * in the order they were evaluated so the auditor can see the brain's
 * train-of-thought; the chosen branch is marked separately on the trace
 * itself (NOT on the branch — keeps the branch record self-contained
 * and makes "branches considered" trivial to enumerate).
