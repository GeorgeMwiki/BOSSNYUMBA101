 * `audit_hash` that chains into the *region's* tamper-evident hash
 * chain (see spec §11). The chain is per-region (not global) so
 * verification is O(posts(region)) and a tamper anywhere in the
 * region's history is surfaced as a single broken-index event.
 *
 * Reuses `@bossnyumba/audit-hash-chain`'s pure `chainHash` and
 * `verifyChain` primitives.
