/**
 * Canonical user-facing display identity for Mr. Mwikila — BossNyumba repo.
 *
 * The user always sees ONE string in the chat UI:
 *   "Mr. Mwikila — Boss Nyumba's AI Property Operations Manager".
 *
 * No specialisation subtitle. No agent_id. No "tenant onboarding
 * advisor" or "lease renewal specialist" suffix. Mr. Mwikila is
 * presented as ONE intelligence that knows everything.
 *
 * The specialisation / agent_id / internal subtitle continue to exist
 * in the data model for:
 *   - Backend routing (which specialisation logic the LLM draws from
 *     on each turn).
 *   - Audit logs (`agent_turns` and `cognitive_turns` capture the
 *     specialisation that produced each artifact).
 *   - Owner admin UI (the owner CAN see the active specialisation in
 *     the admin junior management panel — this is the ONLY surface
 *     that exposes the internal name).
 *
 * This module is intentionally tiny and side-effect free so every
 * surface (chat panel, floating widget, home shell, marketing pages)
 * can import the same constant and never drift.
 *
 * Spec: see Docs/DESIGN/CAPABILITIES_UNIFICATION.md "User-facing
 * identity is locked".
