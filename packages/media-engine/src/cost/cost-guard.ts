/**
 * Cost guard — a pre-spend budget ceiling, NOT a ledger posting.
 *
 * Before a provider is invoked the engine asks the guard whether the
 * estimated cost fits inside the per-tenant remaining budget. The guard
 * reserves the estimate; on success it commits, on failure/timeout it
 * releases. This caps spend deterministically and never touches
 * `LedgerService.post()` (money-path hard rail — see SOTA spec §5).
 *
 * The guard is in-memory + injectable: the host can swap a durable
 * implementation. Reservations are immutable snapshots.
