/**
 * Language Agent Tree Search (LATS) — Zhou ICML 2024 (arXiv:2310.04406).
 *
 * MCTS over **action trajectories** (not tokens) with UCB1 selection and
 * a reflection-based value-network shortcut. The L1 audit deferred this as
 * "overkill for MD" — true for single-turn decisions, but BOSSNYUMBA has
 * very real long-horizon flows where the action space is large and feedback
 * is sparse:
 *
 *   - 60-day lease renewal (send-early / wait / discount / partial / not)
 *   - 30-day onboarding (KYC → contract → deposit → keys → first inspection)
 *   - 90-day eviction (notice → cure period → court filing → hearing → enforcement)
 *   - monthly KRA cycle (compute → file → settle → reconcile)
 *
 * Each "action" advances the state by one symbolic step. The reflection
 * callback consults K-D's Reflexion store (lessons from prior renewals)
 * to prune branches that have failed before in similar conditions.
