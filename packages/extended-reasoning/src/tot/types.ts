/**
 * raw Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) — Yao 2023 (arXiv:2305.10601).
 *
 * The L1 audit said "use Self-Discover instead". That advice holds when the
 * task structure is unknown and must be discovered. But BOSSNYUMBA has many
 * decision points where the structure is **FIXED**: eviction-decision tree,
 * vendor-selection tree, KRA-filing-route tree, tenant-screening tree.
 *
 * For these, raw ToT with a pre-built tree is strictly faster than
 * Self-Discover — we skip the discovery cost and walk a known graph.
