 * LITFIN-parity item 4. Append-only event store scoped to the
 * rent + arrears critical paths (full payments-ledger event-sourcing
 * is a future iteration).
 *
 * Two adapters: in-memory for tests/dev, Drizzle for prod. Projector
 * helper builds read models from streams. The schema lives in
 * `packages/database/src/migrations/0273_payment_event_store.sql`.
