/**
 * AIReviewerPort — the boundary the engine talks to when a run reaches
 * `in_review`. The actual implementation lives in `@bossnyumba/ai-reviewer`
 * (policy-based + multi-LLM brain). The engine only needs the shape.
 *
 * Decoupling rationale:
 *   - The engine MUST work in tests without the LLM dependency. We pass
 *     a stub that returns a deterministic verdict.
 *   - The reviewer evolves on its own cadence; bumping its policies
 *     should not require a workflow-engine release.
