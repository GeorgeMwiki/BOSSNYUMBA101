/**
 * Canonical user-facing display identity for Mr. Mwikila — chat-ui mirror.
 *
 * The user always sees ONE string in the chat UI:
 *   "Mr. Mwikila — Boss Nyumba's AI Property Operations Manager".
 *
 * No specialisation subtitle. No agent_id. Mr. Mwikila is presented as
 * ONE intelligence that knows everything.
 *
 * This module is a mirror of `@bossnyumba/agent-platform`'s
 * `canonical-display.ts` — the agent-platform module is the source of
 * truth for the backend; this module is the source of truth for the
 * UI surface. Both share the same strings; the chat-ui tests pin the
 * exact values so the two never drift.
 *
 * We mirror rather than import because chat-ui has no direct
 * dependency on agent-platform — the persona surface is intentionally
 * decoupled so the rendering layer can be swapped (web ↔ mobile ↔
 * marketing) without dragging the agent runtime in.
 *
 * Spec: Docs/DESIGN/CAPABILITIES_UNIFICATION.md "User-facing identity
 * is locked".
