/**
 * Capability registry — disclosure-safe types.
 *
 * Single source of truth for what BOSSNYUMBA / Mr. Mwikila CAN do, expressed
 * as USER OUTCOMES (never internal mechanics). Every chat surface
 * (public-chat, brain-teach, voice, push, email) reads from this registry
 * when the user asks "what can you do" / "how does this work" / "are you AI".
 *
 * RT-1 — REASONING GUIDELINES, NOT SCRIPTS.
 * Each entry's `public_description` and `example_response_pattern` fields
 * are semantically `reasoning_hint` and `example_reasoning_trace`. They
 * GUIDE the model's fresh composition — they are NOT verbatim scripts.
 * See `reasoningHint()` / `exampleReasoningTrace()` helpers below for
 * the semantically named accessors.
 *
 * Disclosure discipline (CSA-1):
 *   - PUBLIC          — safe to mention freely; outcome-only language.
 *   - INTERNAL        — describe outcome only, NEVER mention mechanics
 *                       (no service names, no agent counts, no tool ids).
 *   - EXPERIMENTAL    — "we're exploring this — want early access?"
 *
 * Bilingual (sw + en). The owner persona defaults to sw; en is the
 * fallback when the request language is en.
 *
 * Ported from Borjie (CSA-1 / RT-1) — real-estate retailored:
 * the user OUTCOMES describe drafting leases, chasing rent, tracking
 * licences (rental + agency), maintenance work-orders, and viewings —
 * never mining concepts (royalty, mineral codes, LBMA, EIA).
