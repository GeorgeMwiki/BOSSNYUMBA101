/**
 * Light-touch bridge from the sustainability advisor to the carbon-market
 * trading-desk layer.
 *
 * The advisor is the brain's entry-point for ESG work; some callers also
 * want to *act* on the recommendations (book forwards, run compliance
 * checks). This helper hands them a ready-to-use `TradingDesk` without
 * forcing them to know that `@bossnyumba/carbon-market` exists.
 *
 * For tests / production they can still construct the desk directly via
 * the carbon-market package's own factories — this is purely convenience.
