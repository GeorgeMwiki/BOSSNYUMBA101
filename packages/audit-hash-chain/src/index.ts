/**
 * `@bossnyumba/audit-hash-chain` — public surface.
 *
 * Hash-chain audit primitive ported from LITFIN (PO-14). Pure
 * functions for canonical JSON, sha256/hmac row hashing, chain
 * append, tamper-evident verification, and secret rotation.
 *
 * No I/O, no DB. The caller persists the entries however they like —
 * Supabase, SQLite, JSON file, Trillian. Verification is also pure,
 * so a cron job can pull the chain and recompute.
