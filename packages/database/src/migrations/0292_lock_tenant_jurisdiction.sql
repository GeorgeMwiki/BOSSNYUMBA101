-- =============================================================================
-- Migration 0292 — Lock tenant jurisdiction at signup (JC-4).
--
-- Carbon-copy of Borjie migration 0149_lock_tenant_jurisdiction.sql, ported
-- by the DIM-D parity audit (2026-05-30) to close the JC-4 gap on
-- BossNyumba. The numbering differs because BossNyumba's 0149 slot is
-- already occupied by `0149_sensor_routing_control.sql` — per the
-- "Migrations are immutable" hard rule we append at 0292 rather than
-- shadowing the existing slot.
--
-- Companion to:
--   - services/api-gateway/src/routes/orgs/signup.hono.ts (JC-5 wiring)
--   - services/api-gateway/src/routes/admin/tenant-jurisdiction.hono.ts (JC-7 override)
--
-- Per the JC-2 / JC-6 invariant: a tenant CANNOT self-change their
-- jurisdiction via chat or settings. Only BOSSNYUMBA internal admins
-- (admin-web role) can revoke + reassign — through a four-eye
-- approval flow with a full audit chain entry.
--
-- This migration:
--
--   1. Adds `tenants.jurisdiction_locked_at` — the timestamp at
--      which the tenant's jurisdiction (country / regulator_set /
--      etc.) was frozen. Set automatically at signup (JC-5).
--
--   2. Adds `tenants.jurisdiction_locked_by_user_id` — Supabase user
--      id of the actor who locked it. NULL for backfilled rows since
--      the historical signup user may not be reliably attributable.
--
--   3. Backfills existing tenants as locked (defensive) — every row
--      with a non-null `country` (or `country_code`) gets a
--      `jurisdiction_locked_at` equal to its `created_at`. This
--      prevents any legacy tenant from accidentally falling through
--      the JC-6 self-change refusal.
--
-- BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: no read-path breaks. The columns are
-- defaulted NULL and the backfill sets them to a sensible value;
-- the JC-5 signup writer will populate them for new tenants.
--
-- Idempotent (IF NOT EXISTS + DO blocks). Forward-only. Append-only.
-- IMMUTABLE: per CLAUDE.md "Migrations are immutable" — never edit
-- this file after merge; append a new numbered file instead.

-- Backfill existing tenants. We treat the country / country_code
