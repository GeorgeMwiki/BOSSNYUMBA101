/**
 * Kernel feedback port — duck-typed structural interface the kernel
 * reads from at step 4 (memory recall) WITHOUT compile-time depending
 * on `@bossnyumba/database`. The api-gateway composition root binds
 * this to the Drizzle-backed `createFeedbackService(db)`. Test rigs
 * bind in-memory fakes.
 *
 * Mirrors LITFIN's online-learning feedback loop, scoped to property:
 * stock LLMs are STATIC, so without an explicit feedback channel the
 * same hallucination repeats forever. The kernel mixes the user's
 * recent feedback (verbatim corrections + a per-category negative-
 * rate) into the system prompt so the next turn is biased toward
 * conservative, citation-heavy output when the user has been pushing
 * back lately.
 *
 * The shapes here intentionally mirror `FeedbackEntry` /
 * `FeedbackSignal` in `packages/database/src/services/kernel-feedback.
 * service.ts` so the production service is structurally compatible
 * with this port without any adapter glue.
