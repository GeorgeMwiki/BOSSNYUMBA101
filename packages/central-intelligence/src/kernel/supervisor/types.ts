/**
 * Supervisor hierarchy types — CEO -> 6 dept managers -> 15 task-agents.
 *
 * Pattern (Anthropic "Building Effective Agents" 2024 + 2026 refresh):
 *   Orchestrator-worker (hierarchical). A CEO supervisor reasons about
 *   the user request, picks one or more departments, hands off to each
 *   manager, and aggregates the managers' decisions into a single plan
 *   the executor / action-tools layer can ground.
 *
 * Design rules:
 *   - Every manager is a PURE FUNCTION (request, taskAgentRegistry,
 *     llmClient) => Plan. No I/O, no DB, no hidden state. The CEO is
 *     also pure under the same signature; it composes managers.
 *   - The task-agent registry is the *only* place a manager can name
 *     a worker. Unknown ids surface in `manager.warnings` not as
 *     thrown exceptions.
 *   - Eviction is gated by constitution C09 (NO-AUTONOMOUS-FILING):
 *     every eviction plan has `requiresHumanApproval: true` AND
 *     `gatedBy: ['C09-NO-AUTONOMOUS-FILING']`.
 *   - The CEO uses the multi-LLM synthesizer (mixture-of-agents,
 *     Wang et al. 2024) when an LLM-typed router is supplied — three
 *     proposers reduce blind spots on routing decisions; jury mode is
 *     preferred for routing to avoid synthesizer hallucinations of
 *     department names.
