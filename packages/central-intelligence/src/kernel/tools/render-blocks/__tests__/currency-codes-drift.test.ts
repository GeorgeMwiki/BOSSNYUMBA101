/**
 * Currency-mirror drift test.
 *
 * DA1 MEDIUM finding: `currency-codes.ts` mirrors
 * `packages/domain-models/src/common/currencies.ts` so the
 * `@bossnyumba/central-intelligence` package can stay zero-runtime-dep
 * on domain-models (identical pattern to `regulatory-mirror.ts`). The
 * downside: if either side drifts, the renderer silently rejects valid
 * tenant currencies (or worse, accepts ones the rest of the system
 * doesn't know about). This test fails at build time when that drift
 * occurs.
 *
 * Contract: the local mirror MUST be a strict SUPERSET of
 * `SUPPORTED_CURRENCY_CODES` from `@bossnyumba/domain-models`. The
 * mirror is allowed to be ahead (we can pre-stage new codes in the
 * brain↔UI wire protocol before they reach money.ts); it MUST NOT be
 * behind.
 *
 * Import path note: central-intelligence intentionally lists no
 * runtime dependency on domain-models. The relative-path import here
 * works because vitest's `include: ['src/**.test.ts']` plus
 * tsconfig's `exclude: ['**.test.ts']` means this file is NEVER part
 * of the production build — only the test runner ever resolves it.
