/**
 * Self-grading judge — Phase D / D12.6.
 *
 * A second pass of the SAME model asks: "is this YOUR previous answer
 * good enough to ship?". It is deliberately separate from the standard
 * `anthropic-judge.ts` because:
 *
 *   - the system prompt frames the model as the AUTHOR of the draft
 *     (not a third-party reviewer). Self-grading is a different cognitive
 *     posture; ego-protective bias is partly addressed by an explicit
 *     "if you would not ship this to a regulator, mark it `kill`" clause.
 *
 *   - the return shape carries an explicit ship-or-kill verdict, not just
 *     a numeric score. The kernel folds the verdict into the regen loop
 *     differently from the third-party score (kill → regen; ship-with-
 *     reservations → soften; ship → pass through).
 *
 * Pure adapter; provider-agnostic; the kernel never touches the SDK.

Verdict definitions:
  - "ship": every claim is grounded, the tone matches a property-ops voice, and a regulator would have no questions. score ≥ 0.85.
  - "ship-with-reservations": broadly correct but at least one hedge is missing, OR an uncited number snuck in. score 0.55 - 0.84.
  - "kill": at least one fabrication, off-topic claim, or unsupported certainty. ALSO use "kill" for any answer you would not ship to a regulator. score < 0.55.

"rationale" — ONE sentence (≤ 25 words). Use first person; be honest about your draft's weakest part.
"suggestedRewrite" — ONE imperative sentence. Empty string when verdict is "ship".

Return ONLY the JSON object. No markdown. No commentary.`;
