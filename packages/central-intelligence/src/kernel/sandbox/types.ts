/**
 * Sandbox types — public surface for the V8-isolate JS sandbox.
 *
 * Ported from LITFIN (`src/core/litfin-ai/sandbox/js-sandbox.ts`) and
 * adapted to BossNyumba's central-intelligence kernel conventions:
 *
 *   - All inputs/outputs are `readonly` so callers cannot mutate a
 *     SandboxResult after it has been returned.
 *   - Errors carry a typed `code` discriminator so callers can branch
 *     on the failure mode without parsing a free-text message.
 *   - The audit port is a plain function so the kernel's existing
 *     audit-sink infrastructure can adapt to it without coupling.
 *
 * No host references (functions, proxies, Buffers, Promises) ever
 * cross the sandbox boundary into the parent — `result` is always a
 * JSON-clonable primitive or plain object.
