/**
 * Registry-backed line-worker catalogue (Gap 6).
 *
 * A VP decides whether to spawn a line-worker or record a capability gap by
 * asking its `VpLineWorkerCatalogue` whether the named line-worker is
 * registered AND in scope. This adapter answers `has()` from the sub-MD
 * registry: a line-worker is "available" when a real sub-MD factory resolves
 * for its id (canonical or hyphen alias).
 *
 * VP line-workers with no sub-MD yet (`tenant.onboarding-officer`,
 * `utility-billing-clerk`, `employee-coordinator`, etc.) resolve to `false`,
 * so the VP records an honest `VpCapabilityGap` instead of emitting a spawn
 * the dispatch chain could not run.
 *
 * Pure value module — no I/O. The scope is threaded through for the
 * defense-in-depth tenant guard; today availability is scope-independent
 * (the same eight sub-MDs ship for every tenant), but the signature matches
 * the catalogue contract so a per-tenant enrolment store can drop in later.
