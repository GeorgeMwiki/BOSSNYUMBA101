/**
 * Property-management three-voice debate preset.
 *
 * Adapts LITFIN's 3-voice credit-decision debate (Proposer = Credit-
 * Mind quantitative / Critic = Rules-engine compliance / Synthesizer =
 * Borrower-advocate) to BOSSNYUMBA's property-management domain. The
 * three pinned voices are:
 *
 *   1. CONSERVATIVE_LANDLORD — anchors on property value, rent
 *      collection, tenant churn cost, lease enforcement. Confident,
 *      numbers-first. Argues for the landlord's protected position
 *      without inventing facts the context does not provide.
 *
 *   2. PRO_TENANT — anchors on tenant rights, fair-housing, habit-
 *      ability obligations, rental tribunal precedent. Pushes back on
 *      anything that would expose the landlord to discrimination or
 *      retaliation claims. Cites statute or tribunal ruling when
 *      possible.
 *
 *   3. PRAGMATIC_PM — the property-manager synthesiser. Re-reads both
 *      and produces the final recommendation: minimum-friction path
 *      that preserves owner economics, treats the tenant fairly, and
 *      keeps the property within compliance. MUST address every
 *      pro-tenant concern before issuing a recommendation.
 *
 * Use cases — contested decisions:
 *   - Eviction (rent arrears past statutory cure period)
 *   - Lease termination for cause (nuisance, illegal use)
 *   - Deposit dispute (damage assessment, withholding)
 *   - Complaint triage (habitability vs preference)
 *   - Renewal denial (problem tenant, no statutory violation)
 *
 * Why an orchestrator pattern? Single-prompt LLM calls tend to
 * rubber-stamp the framing of the input. Three explicit voices force
 * structurally different perspectives so the synthesis cannot
 * collapse to any single voice's bias.
