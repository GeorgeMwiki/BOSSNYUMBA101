/**
 * Self-healing kernel — a bounded, honest MAPE-K loop for UI/wiring blockers.
 *
 * MAPE-K (Monitor → Analyze → Plan → Execute over Knowledge) is the autonomic-
 * computing reference for self-adaptive systems (IBM, 2003). This is that loop,
 * scoped to the generative-UI flow and held to four honest limits learned the
 * hard way:
 *
 *   1. AUTO-REPAIR ONLY THE BOUNDED SAFE CLASS. A blocker that can be served by
 *      an existing DECLARATIVE move — degrade to the honest fallback, re-bind to
 *      the generic resolver — is auto-repaired. Everything else escalates.
 *   2. NEVER AUTO-REWRITE CODE. A blocker that needs a code/wiring change
 *      (a missing renderer, an unwired rule, a dead export) is turned into a
 *      structured, human-gated `RepairProposal` (`autoApplicable: false`). The
 *      system does not edit its own source autonomously — that line is not
 *      crossed.
 *   3. NEVER SILENT. Every blocker yields an outcome — auto-repaired or
 *      escalated — and an unrecognised one is MADE KNOWN as `novel`, not
 *      swallowed (the residual doctrine: instrument what you cannot enumerate).
 *   4. ALWAYS PROCEED. The outcome's `proceed` is always true: the user keeps
 *      being served (via degrade / deferToBrain) WHILE the repair or escalation
 *      happens. Self-healing never blocks the flow it is healing.
 *
 * The healer is itself TOTAL: it never throws, even on a malformed signal or a
 * failing sink — a self-healer that can crash is a contradiction.
