/**
 * Deterministic, dependency-free PRNG for the spec-space exhaustiveness proof.
 *
 * The totality fuzz (Law 1: every schema-valid spec is safe) MUST be fully
 * reproducible: a green run today and a green run on CI six months from now have
 * to exercise the EXACT same spec space, so a regression surfaces as the same
 * failing seed rather than a heisenbug. That rules out `Math.random()` and any
 * wall-clock seeding — every bit of pseudo-randomness here is fed by a fixed
 * integer seed the caller iterates.
 *
 * `mulberry32` is a tiny, well-known 32-bit generator with a full 2^32 period
 * and good-enough distribution for structural fuzzing (we are not doing
 * cryptography — we are walking a finite spec lattice). Implemented inline so
 * the package keeps its zero-runtime-dependency posture (only zod).
 *
 * The whole module is pure: a `Prng` is a closure over a single mutable cursor
 * that is private to the closure; callers only ever see fresh return values, so
 * no shared state leaks across the generator. Re-seeding with the same integer
 * always replays the identical stream.
 *
