/**
 * Extension contract — the SINGLE canonical statement of what it takes to
 * add a new capability to `@bossnyumba/portal-genui` without leaving a mis-wire.
 *
 * Law 2 (closed-under-extension) and Law 3 (catch the mis-wire we did not
 * imagine) both reduce to one rule: every new field/widget KIND, and every
 * new cross-cutting CONCERN, must arrive together with the artifacts the
 * runtime needs — never one half. A kind without a registry entry renders
 * nothing; a registry entry without an enum member is unreachable; a concern
 * without an admission rule is a hole the next poisoned spec walks straight
 * through. None of those is a type error — `tsc` is happy with a half-wired
 * extension. This module names the obligations so the companion test
 * (`__tests__/wiring-completeness.test.ts`) can FAIL the merge that ships one.
 *
 * Pure data + pure functions. No I/O, no React, no `process.env`. The test
 * pairs these constants against the live `types.ts` enums and the
 * `fields/widgets` registries it imports read-only.

// 1. What a NEW KIND must provide (the extension checklist).
// ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * The obligations every new field/widget kind owes. Each is a real seam in
 * the package: skip one and the kind is half-wired in a way `tsc` will not
 * catch. The wiring-completeness test asserts the live registries satisfy
 * every checklist item for every enum member, so a kind cannot appear
 * without all of them.
 *
 *   - `enum-member`   — listed in `PORTAL_TAB_FIELD_KINDS` /
 *                       `PORTAL_TAB_WIDGET_KINDS` (`types.ts`), so the Zod
 *                       `z.enum` admits it at parse time.
 *   - `registry-entry`— a `FIELD_KIND_REGISTRY` / `WIDGET_KIND_REGISTRY`
 *                       record keyed by the kind.
 *   - `renderer`      — a non-empty `rendererName` the React layer maps to a
 *                       component (this package stays React-free, so the name
 *                       is the contract).
 *   - `validator`     — fields: `buildValueValidator`; widgets: `configSchema`
 *                       — the parse-time gate on instance values / config.
 *   - `preview`       — fields: `mockValue`; widgets: `sampleConfig` — the
 *                       tab-builder preview cannot render an unknown kind.

/**
 * The cross-cutting concerns the persist/patch chokepoint (`engine.ts`,
 * `guardForPersist`) must clear before a generated tab is stored. Adding a
 * new concern (say a future PII scrubber) without registering it here — and
 * without an admission rule below — would let a tab slip through ungoverned.
 * The test asserts the admission-coverage map names exactly this set, so a
 * concern cannot be added in code without being declared a first-class
 * obligation.
 *
 *   - `egress`        — `assertSpecUrlsAllowed` (url-egress membrane): no
 *                       attacker URL the renderer would auto-fetch.
 *   - `audit`         — `sealAuditChain`: tamper-evident, append-only
 *                       provenance stamped at the chokepoint.
 *   - `evidence`      — CLAUDE.md "evidence-required AI output": a generated
 *                       surface must trace to its source (auditable provenance
 *                       / source conversation), never an empty chain.
 *   - `locale`        — CLAUDE.md absolute EN/SW separation: the active render
 *                       locale is authority-controlled, never free-mixed on a
 *                       generated surface.
 *   - `action-binding`— a widget `binding` resolves only to a CLOSED, vetted
 *                       resource/tool set (capability registry), never an
 *                       arbitrary table/RPC string.
