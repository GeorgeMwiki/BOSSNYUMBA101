/**
 * `@bossnyumba/brain-llm-router/cost-meter` — public surface.
 *
 * Per-call $ tracking with per-tenant accumulator + observability
 * hooks. Reuses `MODEL_PRICING` / `computeCost` from cost-cascade.
 *
 * Distinct from cost-cap (which gates spend) and cost-cascade (which
 * picks cheap-first). This module just RECORDS what was actually
 * spent on each call, so:
 *   - the K-B receipt UX can show "this convo cost $0.043"
 *   - the SRE dashboard can show $/min per tenant
 *   - Prometheus can scrape per-tenant cumulative USD
