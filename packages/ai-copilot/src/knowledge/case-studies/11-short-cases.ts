    narrative: `Seven of 24 units in a Kinondoni walk-up have slipped into a stable 30-45 day arrears rhythm. The owner is an upcountry banker who takes a 10-day trip home every quarter, and the caretaker has grown accustomed to excuses — "TSh 200k on Friday," "school fees this week," "GePG was down." The ledger shows balances bouncing between TSh 450k and TSh 1.2M per unit, never clearing, never escalating. Late fees are in the lease but never applied. Tenant turnover is low, which the owner reads as loyalty; Mr. Mwikila reads it as a pattern of tolerated slippage that has become the new normal.

Three of the seven tenants are long-standing (>5 years); two are recent; two are tied to the same M-Pesa sender, hinting at a family cluster. Rent across the 24 units is TSh 380-420k; total arrears on any given day hover at TSh 6.5M — roughly two weeks of gross collections. The owner asks whether to "just write it off and move on."`,

Mr. Mwikila walks the block with the building engineer. Two of the 20 units have had new tenants within the last year, both of whom installed extra washing machines without notification. One meter has a cracked housing and reads low. The bulk meter on the compound shows KSh 42k more consumption than the sum of unit meters — an almost-perfect match for the gap.

The owner considers three actions: (1) raise service charge 3 percent to absorb; (2) replace all 20 unit meters at KSh 8,000 each; (3) investigate the meter drift and bill the two washing-machine tenants retroactively.

Mr. Mwikila's read: the bunching is legacy from an opening campaign in 2022. The 90/60/30 renewal cadence has been applied reactively rather than proactively; by the time December hits, the leasing agent is doing 14 renegotiations at once and drops three.`,

Mr. Mwikila's read: East African courts generally enforce late fees if they are (a) clearly stated, (b) a reasonable pre-estimate of the landlord's loss, and (c) not punitive. A 5% compounding monthly fee is aggressive. The landlord's position is strong on (a) but weaker on (b) and (c).`,

Mr. Mwikila's take: geography diversification cuts portfolio volatility 20-30% if the assets are not correlated. Mombasa tourism correlates with coastal KSh/USD flows more than Nairobi office.
