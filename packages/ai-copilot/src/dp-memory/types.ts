/**
 * DP-Memory — Wave 28 Agent DP-MEMORY.
 *
 * Types for the differential-privacy cross-tenant pattern-memory layer.
 *
 * Motivation:
 *   - Today BOSSNYUMBA is strictly per-tenant isolated. Patterns learned
 *     from tenant A (e.g. "2BR units in Westlands lease within 14 days
 *     on average") cannot inform defaults for tenant B, even though doing
 *     so would materially reduce cold-start pain for new operators.
 *   - Differential privacy (Dwork & Roth, 2014, "The Algorithmic
 *     Foundations of Differential Privacy") gives us a rigorous framework
 *     for releasing aggregates that provably do not leak individual-row
 *     facts from the source tenants.
 *   - This module defines the *narrow* shapes the DP pipeline speaks:
 *     queries (what is asked), results (the noisy answer + confidence),
 *     budgets (how much epsilon each tenant has spent), and shared
 *     defaults (the DP-protected industry benchmark table).
 *
 * Design principles:
 *   - Immutable data only. Every returned object is a fresh shape with
 *     `readonly` fields. Callers must never mutate.
 *   - Pre-aggregated inputs only. The aggregator and DP layers NEVER see
 *     per-row records — sources feed in already-bucketed counts / means /
 *     quantiles, and the consent manager gates the contribution set.
 *   - Transparent sample-size + epsilon reporting. Any published default
 *     carries the epsilon spent and the underlying sample size so
 *     consumers can weight the signal themselves.
