/**
 * Brain Event Bus — types module.
 *
 * The company-brain primitive (Wave-2 task #10 of
 * `.audit/litfin-sota-2026-05-23/00-EXECUTION-ROADMAP.md`, research
 * report `11-company-brain-primitive.md`) ingests scattered tenant
 * communications into a single, ACL-tagged event stream.
 *
 * Two non-negotiable design constraints derived from the SOTA-2026
 * landscape (Onyx, Glean, Notion, Microsoft Graph Connectors):
 *
 *   1. **ACL is ingested AT THE SAME TIME as content** — never
 *      post-filtered. Glean / Onyx call this "permission-aware
 *      ingestion": a DM stays a DM, a private channel never leaks via
 *      answer aggregation. This module's `BrainEventACL` mirrors that
 *      contract: every event carries the full set of (userIds + roleIds)
 *      that may read it, captured at emit time from the source system.
 *
 *   2. **Tenant isolation is mandatory** — every event carries a
 *      `tenantId`. The bus rejects events with empty tenant ids in
 *      strict mode and logs+drops in lenient mode (used for tests).
 *      Cross-tenant fan-out is impossible by construction.
 *
 * This module deliberately does NOT pull in `@bossnyumba/observability`'s
 * `EventBus`. The platform's domain-event bus is shaped for
 * aggregate-root DDD events (PaymentReceived, LeaseTerminated) — the
 * brain bus is shaped for **communication ingestion**: stream-like,
 * ACL-first, with a different read model (per-user / per-role).
 * Re-using the observability bus would have meant grafting ACL onto a
 * shape that was never meant to carry it. Keeping the surfaces
 * separate is the cleaner long-term split.
 *
 * Onyx ACL pattern reference:
 *   https://docs.onyx.app/overview/core_features/connectors
 *   "Permission-aware ingestion — every connector ingests ACL metadata
 *    at the same time as content. The retriever filters at query time
 *    using the asking user's ACL graph."
 *
 * Glean Skills ACL reference:
 *   https://www.glean.com/blog/glean-skills-launch-2026
 *   "Source-based ACL inheritance is non-negotiable."

 * The set of (userIds, roleIds) is the **closed-world** list of
 * principals that may read this event. Empty `userIds` + empty
 * `roleIds` is intentionally NOT a wildcard — it means **no-one** can
 * read the event and the event is effectively quarantined. Use this
 * for content the system ingested but cannot yet attribute (e.g. an
 * unknown sender on an inbound webhook) so the data lands but stays
 * un-readable until a downstream re-tag step resolves the identity.
 *
 * Public events (e.g. tenant-wide announcements) are modelled by
 * including the tenant's "all-members" roleId (resolved by the source
 * connector) in `roleIds`, NOT by leaving both lists empty.
