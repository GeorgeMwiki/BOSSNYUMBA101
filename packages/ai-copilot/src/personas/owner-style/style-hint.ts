/**
 * Style Hint — projects a learned OwnerStyleProfile into a concise,
 * deterministic directive paragraph that future turns fold into the persona
 * system prompt.
 *
 * Strategy (mirrors LitFin's prompt-adapter but minimal + additive):
 *   - Only dimensions confident enough (>= CONFIDENCE_FLOOR) emit a line.
 *   - Substance is sacred — we shape the persona's tone / verbosity / detail /
 *     decision-risk posture, never the user's content.
 *   - Language: we surface the learned LEAN as a soft hint only. The ABSOLUTE
 *     EN/SW toggle is owned by user settings and must win at render time; this
 *     hint never overrides it (CLAUDE.md: toggle is absolute, no mixing).
 *
 * Returns an empty string when the profile is not yet confident — callers then
 * leave the base system prompt untouched (honest-degrade, no fabrication).
