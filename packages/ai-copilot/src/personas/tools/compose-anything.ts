/**
 * `compose_anything_v1` — meta-tool for the universal-creation MD.
 *
 * Mr. Mwikila is a universal creator. The owner can say "make this NOI
 * pack", "draft a renewal offer for unit 4B", "make me a marketing image
 * for this vacant listing", or "announce the new maintenance policy" — and
 * if BossNyumba has the data (which it should, across leases, rent, units,
 * maintenance, compliance, marketplace, holdings) the brain creates the
 * artefact. The intelligence is NOT for marketing/campaigns alone; it is
 * for creating ANY document or media at ANY moment from the org's joined
 * data.
 *
 * The five atomic capabilities — `research`, `tab`, `doc`, `media`,
 * `campaign` — are invoked freely, in any combination, in any order, in
 * response to whatever the owner needs.
 *
 * This tool is the **dispatcher**: the owner says "make me X" in natural
 * language and the MD picks the smallest atomic capability that fits, then
 * actually invokes it and returns the produced artefact. The dispatcher is
 * Tier 0 (no side effects of its own); the chosen sub-tool may be Tier 0,
 * 1, or 2 and the owner-approval gate is raised at sub-tool dispatch time.
 *
 * This file is a **pure value module** — no I/O, no Drizzle, no Anthropic
 * SDK imports. The kernel composition root wires the executor that
 * dispatches to the chosen capability's package; this module only exposes
 * the contract. Ported from Borjie (domain-neutral; unchanged surface).
