/**
 * MCP ToolSearch — closes R1 gap #9.
 *
 * Problem: every MCP server's tool definitions go into the model context
 * on every request. For BOSSNYUMBA's tenant integrations (Stripe, M-Pesa,
 * Yodlee, KRA, RGS, NEMA, BRELA, NSSF, NHIF...) that's a context-budget
 * cliff. R1 §B.3 calls it out: "MCP schemas deferred by default via
 * ToolSearch".
 *
 * Solution: when a server reports 50+ tools (THRESHOLD), we replace its
 * FULL schemas in context with a single `mcp_tool_search` surface plus
 * minimal descriptors (name + one-line description). The model invokes
 * `ToolSearch.query("send M-Pesa to phone")` → we return ranked candidates
 * with minimal-schema; the FULL schema is loaded only when the model
 * actually calls one of those tools.
 *
 * Cuts initial context bloat by ~80% for big MCP catalogs.
