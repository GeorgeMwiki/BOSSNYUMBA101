/**
 * Filesystem-discovered skill types — closes R1 gap #8.
 *
 * A skill is a DIRECTORY on disk:
 *
 *   <skill_dir>/
 *     SKILL.md            — REQUIRED. YAML frontmatter + Markdown body.
 *     <entrypoint>.ts     — OPTIONAL. Executable code skill (path declared in frontmatter).
 *     prompts/*.md        — OPTIONAL. Sub-prompts the skill can pull in.
 *
 * Discovery walks two roots:
 *
 *   ~/.bossnyumba/skills/                 — platform-wide (user scope)
 *   tenants/<tenantId>/skills/            — tenant-scoped (per-tenant scope)
 *
 * At session start, every SKILL.md is parsed (cheap — frontmatter only) so
 * the orchestrator knows the metadata; the BODY is loaded only when the
 * skill is invoked (contextually loaded, mirroring Claude Code's pattern).
 *
 * A session-scoped allowlist `skills: ['handle-late-rent', 'compile-weekly-report']`
 * filters which skills are SURFACED to the model. Skills not in the
 * allowlist remain on disk (Read/Bash can still reach them) but the model
 * is not told about them.
