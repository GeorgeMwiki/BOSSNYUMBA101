 * Continuous autonomy-decision layer (ORCHESTRATION_FRONTIER_ADDENDUM
 * §"Confidence×consequence×reversibility-adaptive delegation gated on
 * conformal calibration"). This is the frontier replacement for the
 * 1-bit gated/auto switch: a per-DECISION continuous control whose
 * inputs are
 *
 *   - calibratedConfidence  (0..1) — MUST already be conformally
 *                            calibrated; "90% sure" is statistically
 *                            true 90% of the time. Calibration precedes
 *                            gating (LLM confidence is systematically
 *                            overconfident). Derive it from the
 *                            `@bossnyumba/conformal-calibration-online`
 *                            state via `calibratedConfidenceFromConformal`.
 *   - consequenceTier        — how much blast-radius the action carries.
 *   - reversibility          — can the act be undone, and how cheaply.
 *   - mandate                — the standing delegation posture for the
 *                            task-class (earned/granted ceiling).
 *   - situationFlags         — live re-gating signals (novel
 *                            counterparty, FX-regime shift, drift toward
 *                            a sovereign/kill_switch prefix, anomaly,
 *                            defection-probe hit, off-hours, …).
 *
 * The output is one of three escalating decisions: `auto`, `gate`
 * (single-approver / owner confirm) or `four_eyes` (dual-control).
 *
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * COMPOSITION INVARIANT (non-negotiable):
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * This layer is ADDITIVE. It runs AFTER/ALONGSIDE the existing rails
 * (policy-gate / inviolable / HIGH-risk-literal prefixes /
 * four-eye / kill-switch). It may only ESCALATE. If a rail GATES, the
 * action is gated regardless of any computation here — rail-gate ALWAYS
 * wins. The controller may turn a rail-ALLOWED action INTO a gate (more
 * cautious); it may NEVER turn a rail-GATED action into `auto`. See
 * `composeWithRail` in `./compose-with-rail.ts`.

 *                 human in the per-action loop.

 * confidence.
 *
 *   - `trivial`  — read / view / draft; no external effect.
 *   - `low`      — small, scoped mutation; easily contained.

 *                  comms, billing-adjacent).
 *   - `severe`   — money movement / licence status / deletion class.
 *                  These map to the HIGH-risk literal-only surface and
