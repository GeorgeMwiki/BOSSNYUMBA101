/**
 * calibrated-confidence — turn a raw model confidence into the
 * conformally-CALIBRATED confidence that `decideAutonomy` requires.
 *
 * The frontier addendum is explicit: calibration MUST precede gating
 * because LLM confidence is systematically overconfident — "I'm 90%
 * sure" has to be statistically true 90% of the time before confidence
 * is allowed to drive delegation. The calibration substrate already
 * exists in `@bossnyumba/conformal-calibration-online` (Adaptive Conformal
 * Inference, Gibbs & Candès 2021) and `@bossnyumba/calibration-monitor`
 * (Brier / ECE).
 *
 * This module is the thin, pure adapter from that substrate into the
 * decision layer's `calibratedConfidence` input. To preserve this
 * package's wire-agnostic, zero-`@bossnyumba`-dependency substrate boundary
 * (the same reason `RiskTier` is duplicated in `types.ts` rather than
 * imported from central-intelligence), the conformal state is accepted
 * STRUCTURALLY via the `ConformalCoverageView` interface — it is the
 * exact public shape of `OnlineConformalState`/`ConformalDiagnostic`, so
 * the output of `@bossnyumba/conformal-calibration-online`'s `diagnostic()`
 * (or a raw state) drops straight in with no coupling.
 *
 * Mechanism:
 *   - The online conformal `alpha` is the calibrated miscoverage rate;
 *     `1 - alpha` is the calibrated coverage the intervals actually
 *     achieve. When the live window has drifted (observed coverage below
 *     target), we discount toward the realised coverage so the
 *     calibrated confidence cannot exceed what the recent track record
 *     supports — never overstate calibration.
 *   - The raw model confidence is then SHRUNK toward that calibrated
 *     coverage ceiling: `calibrated = min(raw, coverageCeiling)`. A
 *     confident-but-uncalibrated model is pulled down to the rate it has
 *     empirically earned; it can never be inflated above it.
