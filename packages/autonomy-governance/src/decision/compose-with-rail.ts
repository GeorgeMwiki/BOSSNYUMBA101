/**
 * composeWithRail — the load-bearing composition primitive.
 *
 * The continuous autonomy controller (`decideAutonomy`) is ADDITIVE. It
 * runs AFTER/ALONGSIDE the existing inviolable rails (policy-gate,
 * inviolable, HIGH-risk-literal prefixes, four-eye, kill-switch). Its one
 * and only contract with those rails is:
 *
 *   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 *   │  RAIL-GATE ALWAYS WINS. The controller may only ESCALATE.     │
 *   │  - rail GATES  →  result is gated, regardless of the          │
 *   │                   controller's computation.                  │
 *   │  - rail ALLOWS →  the controller may turn it INTO a gate      │
 *   │                   (more cautious) but can NEVER turn a        │
 *   │                   rail-gated action into `auto`.              │
 *   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * This is a pure function with no knowledge of HOW the rail decided. The
 * caller collapses the existing rail stack into a single
 * `RailOutcome` ('allow' | 'gate' | 'four_eyes') and passes it alongside
 * the controller's standalone recommendation. The two are combined by
 * taking the MOST-cautious of the two — which is exactly "rail-gate
 * always wins, controller may only add gating".
 *
 * Because the combine is monotone (max over the escalation order), the
 * invariant holds by construction: there is no input under which a
 * rail-gated outcome can be downgraded to `auto`.
