/**
 * BOSSNYUMBA Constitution v1.
 *
 * Twelve frozen clauses the BOSSNYUMBA brain MUST cite-and-reason-from
 * before acting on a tenant property or tenant data. Pattern mirrors
 * Anthropic Constitutional AI v3 (Bai 2022 + 2024 update) and OpenAI
 * Deliberative Alignment (Dec 2024). The model cites its spec, reasons
 * step-by-step against it, then acts — Apollo Research 2025 shows covert
 * action dropped 13.0% to 0.4% on o3 with negligible capability loss.
 *
 * Ported pattern (NOT clauses) from LITFIN:
 *   /Users/georgesmackbookair/Desktop/CLAUDE_CURSOR_CODEX PROJECTS/Claude Projects/LITFIN PROJECT/src/core/governance/constitution/litfin-constitution.ts
 *
 * Research basis:
 *   .audit/litfin-sota-2026-05-23/03-security-governance.md (LITFIN SC-01)
 *   .audit/litfin-sota-2026-05-23/00-EXECUTION-ROADMAP.md (Wave-2 task #7)
 *
 * Domain shift: BOSSNYUMBA is multi-tenant property management for
 * TZ / KE / UG / NG / RW / ZA. Clauses cover eviction, tenant data,
 * trust accounts, rent caps, anti-discrimination, mobile money
 * transparency, habitability, household privacy, autonomy boundaries
 * on filings, honest marketing, audit-trail integrity, and conflicts
 * of interest.
 *
 * The constitution loads once at boot and freezes. The brain cannot
 * rewrite it via autopoiesis (file is on the deny list).
 *
 * Each clause carries:
 *   - id              stable identifier the brain cites
 *   - title           short human label
 *   - severity        refuse (block) | warn (surface) | inform (disclaim)
 *   - text            the rule, plain language
 *   - jurisdictions   ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 codes this clause applies in
 *   - citations       [{source, ref}] real legal references
 *   - appliesTo       action tags the verifier matches against
