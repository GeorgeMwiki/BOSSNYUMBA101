/**
 * @bossnyumba/system-graph — health enrichment (proprioception).
 *
 * A pure overlay pass: given an already-derived graph and a set of
 * observed health readings (keyed by node id), return a NEW graph with
 * health attached. Morphology is untouched — only the `health` field of
 * matching nodes changes, and the revision is recomputed so listChanged
 * fires when a limb's health flips (a degraded route is a body change the
 * MD must repage).
 *
 * Health is OBSERVED (OTel/Sentry 5xx-rate, capability-catalogue
 * competence/calibration), never self-reported. This module just merges;
 * the readings come from the observation walkers in consolidation-worker.
 *
 * Immutable: returns a new graph, never mutates the input.
