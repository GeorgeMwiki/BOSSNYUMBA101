/**
 * Section registry contract — Phase J3.
 *
 * The vision: BOSSNYUMBA's owner-portal and admin-platform-portal must
 * NOT pre-render a tab for every conceivable entity type. A new tenant
 * starts empty; tabs appear as the MD's entity types come into being
 * (typically via chat-driven kernel actions). When a tenant has zero
 * KRA filings the "Filings" tab is absent. The instant the first one
 * lands, the tab materialises — because the section's
 * `visibility_predicate` flips true.
 *
 * Every Section in the registry declares:
 *   - identity (`key`, `label`, `icon`, `entity_type`)
 *   - a `visibility_predicate` (sum type — see VisibilityPredicate)
 *   - a `component_loader` that returns a dynamic import
 *   - a `sort_order` for stable tab ordering
 *
 * The portals never reach across this contract — they consume the
 * filtered + lazy-loaded sections from `useSectionRegistry()`.
