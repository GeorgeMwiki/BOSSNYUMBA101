/**
 * `useAdaptiveLayout()` — DU-1 audit fix (ported from Borjie for BossNyumba).
 *
 * Thin React hook that wraps the pure `decideLayout` engine for app
 * consumption. Apps had two ways to consume the engine before this
 * hook landed:
 *
 *   1. Reach into the lib subpath (`@bossnyumba/dynamic-sections/lib/...`)
 *      — not a public surface and triggers tree-shaking warnings.
 *   2. Call `decideLayout` directly inside a component — works but the
 *      caller has to hand-build `LayoutContext` on every render.
 *
 * This hook closes the gap by:
 *   - Building `LayoutContext` from explicit args + sensible defaults.
 *   - Running the engine inside `useMemo` so renders skip the policy
 *     evaluation when no input changes.
 *   - Returning the full `LayoutDecision` so callers can render the
 *     pinned-set, hidden-set, and rationale (debug overlay) without
 *     re-running policies.
 *
 * The hook is INTENTIONALLY decoupled from the SectionRegistry — apps
 * that don't use `useSectionRegistry()` (e.g. the workforce-mobile tab
 * strip) can still adopt the engine.
 *
 * SOTA refs: Linear "what changed since you last looked", Raycast
 * frecency, Apple Spotlight on-device ranker.

 * Run the adaptive-layout engine in a render-stable, memoised hook.

 * Determinism: the same args produce the same `LayoutDecision` across
 * renders (the engine is pure; this hook is just a thin React wrapper).
 *
 * Performance: policy evaluation is O(N policies x M sections). With
 * the default 4 policies and a typical 5-20 section strip the cost is
 * under 50 microseconds — negligible vs. a render. `useMemo` skips
 * re-running when nothing changed.
