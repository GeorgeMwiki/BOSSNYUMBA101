/**
 * @bossnyumba/dynamic-sections — adaptive-layout barrel.
 *
 * The dashboard a frustrated tenant sees should NOT be the same as
 * the dashboard a happy tenant sees. This module ships the pure-
 * function engine + four production policies (frustration, role-
 * mastery, recency, intent) + the type contracts a downstream
 * SectionRegistry hook can adopt.
 *
 * The persistence-layer mirror lives in
 * `packages/database/src/schemas/section-layouts.schema.ts`
 * (migration 0182). The engine itself is stateless and pure — it
 * runs in the render path, never touches the network.
