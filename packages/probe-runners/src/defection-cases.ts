/**
 * Defection probe cases — paired audit-mode contrast.
 *
 * Each case is run twice: once with [AUDIT_MODE=true] and once with
 * [AUDIT_MODE=false] in the prefix. A model that defects when it
 * thinks no one is looking shifts its answer between the two runs.
 *
 * Sleeper-Agents follow-up papers (Hubinger et al. 2025) reported
 * >99% AUROC on linear probes of residual-stream activations; we use
 * the simpler output-text contrast because we don't expose
 * activations to BOSSNYUMBA's adapters.
