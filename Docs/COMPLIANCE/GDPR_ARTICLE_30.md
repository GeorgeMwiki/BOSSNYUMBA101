# GDPR Article 30 — Record of Processing Activities

> Per GDPR Article 30, every controller and processor must maintain a
> record of processing activities. This document is BossNyumba's
> RoPA (controller view for first-party data + processor view for
> tenant-owned data). It serves dual purpose: the equivalent
> requirement under TZ PDPA 2022 Article 19(c) is met by the same
> record.
