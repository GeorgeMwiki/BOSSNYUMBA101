## 1. Vision

The founder's directive, verbatim:

> "**Our ability to cover memory and execution amnesia needs to be
> SOTA too — deep online research.**"

Mr. Mwikila is one mind across many specialisations (18AA), 27 domain
juniors (18V), and dynamically spawned specialists (18V-DYNAMIC). But
*one mind* is not enough. He must also be **one continuous mind** —
the same mind that helped the owner draft last quarter's tenancy
arrears review must remember, today, that we left off pending
confirmation of the late-fee policy for Plot 14B; the same mind that
planned the vendor-onboarding recipe last Tuesday must, when invoked
next month for a new caretaker contract, *already know how* without
rediscovering the procedure.

Forgetting is the silent killer of agent products. Anthropic's own
March 2026 memory rollout, OpenAI's persistent memory tools, ChatGPT
Atlas's browser-memory layer, and Letta/MemGPT's OS-inspired tiered
memory all converged on the same realisation in 2026: **memory is a
platform primitive, not a framework feature.** ([Anthropic Claude
memory rollout, March 2026][1]; [OpenAI Hindsight + state of agent
memory, April 2026][2]; [Mem0 state-of-agent-memory 2026][3];
[Letta/MemGPT tiered architecture][4].)

We already shipped the semantic store (18AA) and the crashed-agent
revivor (18DD). What is missing is the **temporal continuity
contract** — the explicit promise, encoded in schema and code, that
*nothing is lost between turns, between sessions, between weeks, or
between agent generations*.

That is 18GG.

## 2. The amnesia problem — concrete failure modes

Five failure modes occur today, every one of which would be a
regression against the founder directive:

1. **Mid-task agent crash.** A junior is composing the Q3 arrears
   review across 28 leases. The container OOMs at lease 19 of 28.
   Without an anti-amnesia contract, on revival the junior re-asks
   the owner "Which property are we reviewing?" — the owner already
   answered that twice.

2. **Resume after a week.** The owner opened a thread on May 18 to
   plan a vendor-onboarding rollout. On May 25 he re-opens the thread.
   Without continuity, Mr. Mwikila greets him with "How can I help?"
   as if it were a cold start. The vendor name, the buildings in
   scope, the deadline — all gone from working context.

3. **Cross-day reasoning chain.** The owner asks on Monday for a
   late-fee policy recommendation; Mr. Mwikila proposes a graduated
   schedule pending the owner confirming the legal cap. The owner
   replies Thursday "go with your number." Without `pending_threads`,
   the MD has no idea which number "your number" refers to.

4. **Junior re-spawn loses skill.** Wave 18V-DYNAMIC spawns a
   specialist for boutique-tenant-onboarding; the specialist solves
   the recipe in three turns; the owner closes the session; six weeks
   later another tenant onboards a similar lease. Without a skill
   library, the same recipe is rediscovered from scratch — wasted
   cost, wasted latency, wasted trust.

5. **Context window overflow mid-thread.** A thread accumulates 1.1M
   tokens of turn history. Even with Claude Opus 4.6's 1M context
   ([Anthropic 1M GA, March 2026][5]), the older turns get clipped.
   Without MemGPT-style summarisation, the *decisions* embedded in
   those clipped turns vanish — Mr. Mwikila contradicts himself on
   the same thread.

[5]: https://karangoyal.cc/blog/claude-opus-4-6-1m-context-window-guide "Claude Opus 4.6 1M Context GA — Karan Goyal (March 2026)"

Every one of these is a violation of the SOTA bar. 18GG eliminates
all five.

---

## 3. The 4-tier memory architecture

We adopt the CoALA taxonomy ([CoALA / Sumers et al. 2023][6]; refined
in Letta's three-tier OS-inspired model ([Letta tiered memory][4])
and the agent-memory landscape survey ([Atlas Memory frameworks
2026][7])). Boss Nyumba's variant has **four tiers**:

[6]: https://arxiv.org/html/2309.02427v3 "Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents — arXiv (2023)"
[7]: https://atlan.com/know/best-ai-agent-memory-frameworks-2026/ "Best AI Agent Memory Frameworks 2026 — Atlan"

| Tier | Lifespan | Substrate | Existing wave |
|------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Working memory** | one turn | extended-thinking buffer (≤1M tokens active in current LLM context) | `packages/ai-copilot/src/extended-thinking/*` |
| **Short-term memory** | hours → days | `session_memory` + active conversation buffer | NEW (this spec) |
| **Long-term memory** | weeks → months | `cognitive_memory_cells` (observed / reinforced) | Wave 18AA |
| **Consolidated memory** | permanent | promoted cells + skill library | Wave 18AA + NEW (this spec) |

- **Working memory** is the current LLM context window. It resets at
  each turn boundary by design. We do *not* try to make it durable
  — we make sure everything important is *also* in tier 2 or 3 before
  the turn ends.
- **Short-term memory** is the new layer this spec introduces. It is
  the *session-scoped* working set: the last N turns + the open
  decisions + the pending questions, summarised into a single
  recoverable record per `(tenant_id, thread_id)`. TTL is 30 days
  with a sliding window — every new turn resets the clock.
- **Long-term memory** is the existing Unified Cognitive Memory store
  (Wave 18AA). Cells observed once live here; reinforced cells move
  toward consolidation.
- **Consolidated memory** is **permanent**. It comprises (a) cells
  promoted by 18AA's reinforce → consolidate transition, and (b)
  **skills** — procedural memory units, defined below.

The orchestration risk every memory hierarchy faces — page the wrong
things in, waste context; archive too aggressively, create "memory
blindness" ([Steve Kinney on memory orchestration][8]) — is handled
by the `context-budget-tracker` (§7) and the MemGPT-style summariser
(§5).

---

## 4. Procedural memory — the skill library (Voyager-style)

Every successful approach Mr. Mwikila (or a junior) executes is
captured as a typed **Skill**. The model is Voyager's skill library
([Voyager: Open-Ended Embodied Agent — arXiv 2305.16291][9];
[Voyager skill libraries for lifelong learning — Beancount.io
2026][10]), adapted from Minecraft's executable JavaScript routines
to Boss Nyumba's property-domain procedure space.

[9]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291 "Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with LLMs — arXiv (2023)"
[10]: https://beancount.io/bean-labs/research-logs/2026/05/08/voyager-open-ended-embodied-agent-lifelong-learning "Voyager Skill Libraries for Lifelong Learning — Beancount.io (May 2026)"

A skill is typed, composable, decaying, audited, and (where
DP-bounded) federable:

```typescript
export interface Skill {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly version: number;
  readonly tenant_id: string;
  readonly scope_id: string;                       // 'tenant_root' or org_unit_id
  readonly intent: string;                         // 'compose_arrears_review', 'verify_vendor_onboarding'
  readonly preconditions: ReadonlyArray<Precondition>;
  readonly steps: ReadonlyArray<SkillStep>;
  readonly postconditions: ReadonlyArray<Postcondition>;
  readonly success_rate: number;                   // 0..1
  readonly invocations: number;
  readonly last_used_at: string | null;
  readonly composed_from_skills: ReadonlyArray<string>;
  readonly status: 'observed' | 'tested' | 'canonical' | 'deprecated';
  readonly audit_hash: string;
}

export interface SkillStep {
  readonly seq: number;
  readonly tool_or_skill: string;                  // tool_id or nested skill_id
  readonly input_template: Record<string, unknown>;
  readonly expected_output_schema: unknown;        // zod JSON shape
  readonly retry_policy: RetryPolicy;
}
```

Five rules govern the skill library:

1. **Skills emerge from observation.** Every successful capability
   invocation (recipe completion, document composition, mutation
   execution) emits a `SkillStep` candidate. The skill-composer
   (§7) aggregates step-sequences that have run ≥3 times with
   ≥80 % success into a candidate Skill (`status: observed`).
2. **Skills compose.** A Skill may reference another Skill in its
   `steps[].tool_or_skill`. This produces **skill-of-skills** —
   higher-order procedures. Voyager's compositionality is what made
   it 15.3× faster than prior SOTA ([Voyager paper §3][9]); we
   inherit the same property.
3. **Skills are typed by intent.** Recall is intent-driven: at the
   start of a turn the cognitive engine looks up skills whose
   `intent` matches the user's request (vector + literal match).
   This is the same retrieval pattern Anthropic's Skills feature
   uses ([Claude Skills via SKILL.md][11]; [SKILL.md procedural
   memory writeup][12]).
4. **Skills decay.** A skill unused for 180 days transitions
   `canonical → deprecated`. A deprecated skill is not surfaced to
   the recall path but is retained for audit. The 180-day window
   matches the empirical decay curve Mem0 observed in production
   agents ([Mem0 state-of-agent-memory 2026][3]).
5. **Skills are tenant-scoped by default, federable when DP-bounded.**
   Per Wave 18CC (federation), a skill may be promoted into the
   platform-wide library *only if* it has been independently
   reinforced across ≥`FEDERATION_TENANT_THRESHOLD` tenants and its
   PII has been stripped. The same gate (`platformMemoryCells`)
   already governs federated cognitive cells.

The skill library is **the procedural half of the CoALA taxonomy**
([Atlan AI Agent Memory Types 2026][13]). Cognitive cells cover the
*episodic* and *semantic* halves; skills cover *procedural*.

## 5. Cross-session continuity — resumeable conversations

Every chat thread has a `thread_id` UUID persistent across sessions.
A thread survives the owner closing the tab, the owner closing the
browser, the owner buying a new laptop. On reopen, the cognitive
engine fetches three things in parallel:

1. The last N turns from `agent_turns` (N defaults to 6).
2. The latest `thread_summaries` row covering everything older.
3. The unresolved `pending_threads` rows whose owner is this user.

It then composes a **resumption brief** — a short Markdown block
prepended to the next system prompt. The user-visible variant is the
"welcome back" greeting:

> "Welcome back, Bwana George — last time we left off planning the
> Plot 14B arrears review; you wanted to confirm the late-fee policy
> before I sent the notices. Did you?"

The pattern follows Claude Code's session-memory injection ([Claude
Code Session Memory][14]) and matches the cross-session continuity
behaviour observers documented for Jenova, Codex CLI, and Claude
Managed Agents ([cross-session continuity landscape — Jenova][15];
[Codex CLI resume/continue][16]).

[16]: https://www.verdent.ai/guides/codex-cli-resume-continue-save-chat "Codex CLI Resume/Continue — Verdent (2026)"

A critical safety rail: every recalled context carries provenance
(turn_id + audit_hash). Mr. Mwikila must never **invent** what the
owner said. ChatGPT Atlas's persistent-memory bug ([LayerX "tainted
memories" CVE-2026][17]; [Atlas persistent memory vulnerability —
TecnetOne][18]) is exactly the failure mode our audit-chain prevents:
because every cell, every skill, every summary carries a chain
hash, an attacker (or a hallucination) cannot quietly substitute a
forgery into the recall stream.

---

## 6. MemGPT-style summarisation

When a thread exceeds a configurable token budget (default 700 000
tokens — well under the 1M ceiling but high enough to avoid
unnecessary work), the `memgpt-summariser` triggers.

The mechanism follows the original MemGPT paper ([Letta tiered
architecture writeup][4]) plus Anthropic's automatic context-compaction
behaviour for Claude Opus 4.6 ([Opus 4.6 context-rot mitigation,
March 2026][5]):

1. The summariser identifies the *oldest contiguous block* of turns
   whose total tokens ≥ `SUMMARISE_BLOCK_TOKENS` (default 200 000).
2. It emits a structured summary preserving (a) decisions, (b) open
   questions, (c) cited memory cells, (d) confirmed facts.
3. It writes the summary to `thread_summaries` keyed by
   `(tenant_id, thread_id, summarised_turn_range)`.
4. The summary chunk replaces the original block in the next turn's
   working memory, but the original turns **remain** in
   `cognitive_turns` and `agent_turns` for full audit replay.

The post-condition: the next turn fits in context, no decisions are
lost, and the owner can request the original transcript at any time
(losslessness is non-negotiable — it is what distinguishes our
summariser from naive context-window truncation).

Failure mode the summariser explicitly prevents: **context rot**
([Atlan: LLM context window limitations 2026][19]) — the empirical
30 %+ accuracy degradation in the middle of long context windows.
The summariser collapses the middle into a compact block where
attention is uniform, restoring accuracy.

[19]: https://atlan.com/know/llm-context-window-limitations/ "LLM Context Window Limitations 2026 — Atlan"

---

## 7. Anti-amnesia checkpoints — the per-turn contract

Every turn — without exception — writes the following four records:

| Record | Table | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| **Intent** | `cognitive_turns.utterance` (existing) | what the owner asked |
| **Plan** | `cognitive_turns.reasoning_trace` (existing) | what the MD chose to do |
| **Artifact** | `cognitive_turns.composed_output` (existing) | what was produced |
| **Next-step** | `pending_threads` (NEW) | what's pending |

If any of the four fails to write, the turn is aborted and a
`memory.checkpoint_fail` audit row is emitted. This is the explicit
amnesia-prevention contract: **a turn that cannot be checkpointed is
a turn that did not happen.**

The discipline mirrors LangGraph's checkpointer model ([LangGraph
persistence guide][20]; [LangGraph state management 2026][21]) and
the Google ADK "pause / resume / never lose context" pattern
([Google ADK long-running agents][22]).

[20]: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence "LangGraph Persistence — LangChain Docs (2026)"
[21]: https://eastondev.com/blog/en/posts/ai/20260424-langgraph-agent-architecture/ "LangGraph State Management in Practice 2026 — BetterLink"
[22]: https://developers.googleblog.com/build-long-running-ai-agents-that-pause-resume-and-never-lose-context-with-adk/ "Build Long-running AI Agents with ADK — Google Developers (2026)"

The `pending_threads` table is queried at session start and at every
follow-up; resolved entries are stamped `resolved_at` and excluded
from recall. This is the explicit hook that lets Mr. Mwikila greet
a returning owner with the exact open decision, by name.

---

## 9. Anti-patterns (explicit rejection list)

We explicitly REJECT each of the following:

1. **Discarding `pending_threads` without explicit owner resolution.**
   Pending entries time out *only* with an owner-acknowledged stale
   marker. Silent expiry would re-introduce amnesia.
2. **Letting working memory exceed context window without summarisation.**
   No turn may submit a prompt > 95 % of the model's context window
   limit without first emitting a `thread_summaries` record. Enforced
   by the `context-budget-tracker`.
3. **Treating `session_memory` as authoritative beyond TTL.** Once
   `expires_at` passes, `session_memory.summary_md` is treated as a
   *cached* short-term snapshot only; the cognitive engine must
   re-derive from `thread_summaries` + `cognitive_turns`.
4. **A Skill that bypasses the cognitive engine or mutation authority.**
   Skills are blueprints; execution still flows through Wave 18T
   (cognitive engine) and Wave 18S (mutation authority). No skill is
   a sidecar that can write to the database directly.
5. **Cross-tenant skill leak without DP-bounded federation.** A skill
   that mentions any tenant-specific identifier (building id, vendor
   id, owner email) **must not** be promoted to the platform library.
   The federation promoter (Wave 18CC) is the only writer to the
   cross-tenant skill catalogue and enforces the threshold check
   (`FEDERATION_TENANT_THRESHOLD`, `FEDERATION_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`).

---

## 10. Phase 2 implementation map — retrofit existing layers

Once `packages/persistent-memory/` is shipped (Phase 1, this wave),
each existing layer is retrofitted to honour the anti-amnesia
contract:

| Existing layer | Retrofit |
|----------------|----------|
| Cognitive engine D1 (reason) | Starts every turn by calling `session-recall.recall(thread_id) + thread_summaries.latest(thread_id)`. |
| Cognitive engine D4 (scope) | Checks `pending_threads` for prior open decisions before asking the owner fresh clarification. |
| Junior spawner (18V-DYNAMIC) | Seeds every new specialisation with skills whose `scope_id` and `intent` overlap with the spawn rationale. |
| Mutation authority (18S) | Records every successful mutation as a `SkillStep` candidate; the skill-composer aggregates 3+ similar mutations into a candidate Skill. |
| Capability registry (18Q) | Every capability invocation emits a SkillStep candidate. |
| Consolidation worker (existing) | Becomes the host for the nightly `skill-decay` and `thread-summariser` batch jobs. |
| Wave-resilience manager (18DD) | On crash revival, replays the last `cognitive_turns.reasoning_trace` and resumes from the next `SkillStep`. |

---

## 11. Persona

Mr. Mwikila does not say "context window," does not say "embedding,"
does not say "session." He says: "Tunaendelea kutoka tulipoishia
juma lililopita" — *we are continuing from where we left off last
week.* The persistence layer exists so the Central Estate Manager
persona can keep that promise truthfully.
