## SLO Review Process

### Weekly Review

- Review error budgets consumed
- Identify top error sources
- Prioritize reliability improvements

### Monthly Review

- Compare actuals vs. SLO targets
- Review business KPI trends
- Adjust alert thresholds if needed

### Quarterly Review

- Evaluate SLO target appropriateness
- Review capacity projections
- Plan infrastructure investments

## Incident Management

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Definition | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **SEV1** | Complete service outage | All APIs returning 5xx |
| **SEV2** | Major feature unavailable | Payments not processing |
| **SEV3** | Degraded performance | API latency > 2x normal |
| **SEV4** | Minor issue, workaround available | Report generation slow |

### Incident Response Times

| Severity | Acknowledgment | Initial Response | Status Update |
|----------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| SEV1 | ≤ 5 minutes | ≤ 15 minutes | Every 15 minutes |
| SEV2 | ≤ 15 minutes | ≤ 30 minutes | Every 30 minutes |
| SEV3 | ≤ 1 hour | ≤ 2 hours | Every 2 hours |
| SEV4 | ≤ 4 hours | ≤ 8 hours | Daily |

### Post-Incident Review

All SEV1 and SEV2 incidents require:
1. Incident timeline (within 24 hours)
2. Root cause analysis (within 48 hours)
3. Action items with owners (within 72 hours)
4. Post-mortem review meeting (within 1 week)
