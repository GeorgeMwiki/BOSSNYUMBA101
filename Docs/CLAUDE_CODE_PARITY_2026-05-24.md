# Claude Code Parity Audit — 2026-05-24

**Scope.** Sweep the 13 surface-area primitives the Claude Agent SDK
(formerly Claude Code SDK) shipped through 2026 H1, score our parity
per primitive, list the top 10 gaps, and propose a fix roadmap.

**Method.** Read the published spec for each primitive, then map it to
existing implementations in this monorepo:

  - `packages/agent-platform/` (A2A + planning + agent-card)
  - `packages/agent-runtime/` (THIS PR — file-discovered Claude-Code
    config + hooks + slash commands + sub-agents + skills + MCP
    consumer + memory + permissions)
  - `packages/central-intelligence/src/kernel/orchestrator/` (existing
    9-stage hook chain + 9-outcome HookResult ADT + decision dispatch
    — Phase E.6)
  - `packages/central-intelligence/src/kernel/skill-library/` (Voyager
    skill retriever — Phase k-c)
  - `packages/central-intelligence/src/kernel/sub-mds/` (sub-MD
    substrate — Phase j4)
  - `packages/mcp-server/` (server side — exposes our tools)
  - `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/settings.json` (today's filesystem
    state)

Per the anti-stall discipline, we did NOT touch routes or UI; the new
runtime is wire-only.

**Aggregate parity:** 11 / 17 at **A**, 3 at **B**, 3 at **C**, 2 at

landing the file-discovered runtime.

## 2. Top 10 gaps (ranked by leverage / effort ratio)

| # | Gap                                | Why it matters                             | Effort | Where to land                                       |
|---|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Plan-mode lifecycle               | Lets autonomous loops draft + diff a plan before any write — biggest safety win | M | `agent-runtime/plan-mode/` with `EnterPlanMode` / `ExitPlanMode` + permission flip |
| 2 | Subprocess-script hooks            | Claude Code's most-used hook shape (shell script `.sh` in `.claude/hooks/`) | M | New `agent-runtime/hooks/subprocess-runner.ts` — separate package to keep `agent-runtime` browser-bundle-safe |
| 3 | Worktree isolation API             | Parallel sub-agents safely without conflict | M | `agent-runtime/worktree/` using `git worktree add/remove` |
| 4 | Background tasks API               | Long-running ops + notify-on-complete       | S | Wire `agent-runtime` to existing `central-intelligence/durable/` Inngest functions |
| 5 | Auto memory writer                 | Claude writes its own notes between sessions | S | Add `agent-runtime/memory/auto-write-strategy.ts` — guards on size + dedup |
| 6 | MCP HTTP auth helpers              | Most remote MCP servers gate on Authorization headers / OAuth | S | Extend `MCPHost.startMCPServer` with `auth: { kind: 'bearer'|'oauth'|'mtls' }` |
| 7 | Status-line command                | UX parity in our chat-ui                    | XS | `agent-runtime/status-line/` reads `~/.claude/statusline.json` |
| 8 | Hook handler manifest auto-loader  | Today `loadFileHooks` requires a resolver — for ergonomics support `{ "import": "pkg/path", "export": "fn" }` with allowlisted packages | M | `agent-runtime/hooks/safe-loader.ts` (allowlist guarded) |
| 9 | Slash-command output transform     | Claude Code allows `output` post-processing                | XS | Extend `SlashCommand.outputTransform?: (s: string) => string` |
| 10 | Settings sources telemetry         | "Why was X allowed/denied?" debugging       | XS | Existing audit log already carries `matchedRule`; add `source` to PermissionAuditEntry |

## 3. Recommended fix roadmap

**Phase G.1 — autonomy safety (1-2 days).** Land #1 (plan-mode) and
#3 (worktree isolation). These are the two highest-leverage closes
because they directly enable safe parallel sub-agents inside our
existing autonomy-governance gates (`packages/autonomy-governance/`).

**Phase G.2 — execution ergonomics (1 day).** Land #2 (subprocess
hooks) and #8 (handler manifest auto-loader) so users can drop
shell-script hooks in `.claude/hooks/` exactly the way upstream
Claude Code projects do.

**Phase G.3 — observability (0.5 day).** Land #4 (background tasks
wiring), #5 (auto memory), #7 (status line), #10 (audit source
telemetry). All three are mostly hand-off code to existing
substrates.

**Phase G.4 — MCP polish (0.5 day).** Land #6 (HTTP auth helpers)
and #9 (output transforms).

**Total estimated effort: ~3.5 days** to take parity from ~85% to
~97%. The remaining 3% (full feature flag for `--dangerously-skip-
permissions` parity, full Auto Mode classifier) is intentionally out
of scope — those are anti-features for an autonomy-governance
platform that runs in production tenants.

## 4. What we wired vs what we built fresh

**Wired to existing substrates (no duplication):**

  - **Brain port** — `BrainPort` is a single-method interface
    (`call({ prompt, allowedTools, model })`) that the existing
    `central-intelligence/kernel/router.ts` already satisfies.
    Sub-agents + slash commands call it directly.
  - **Hook events composition** — we mirror the 7 SDK events;
    `central-intelligence/orchestrator/hook-chain.ts` exposes 9
    stages. Two consumers, one mental model.
  - **Skills metadata** — `central-intelligence/kernel/skill-library/
    skill-retriever.ts` already retrieves learned skills via
    embeddings. `agent-runtime/skills` adds the file-discovered
    SKILL.md surface. Both register into the same downstream
    invocation path.
  - **MCP server side** — `packages/mcp-server/` is the producer;
    `packages/agent-runtime/mcp/` is the consumer. Both speak the
    same JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol.
  - **Permission mode flag** — `central-intelligence/orchestrator/
    permission-mode.ts` carries the per-call permission decision into
    the dispatcher. `agent-runtime/permissions` adds the FILE-based
    rule loader (`.claude/settings.json`) feeding into the same
    decision shape.

**Built fresh (no prior implementation):**

  - YAML frontmatter parser (zero deps)
  - File discovery for `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/agents/`,
    `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/hooks/`, `.mcp.json`
  - Memory store with `~/.claude/projects/<encoded>/memory/`
    path encoding + topical-file round-trip
  - `Bash(prefix:*)` glob convention for permission rules
