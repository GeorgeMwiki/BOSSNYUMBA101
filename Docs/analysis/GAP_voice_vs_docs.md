## Conflicts Requiring Founder Decision

### CONFLICT 1: Admin hierarchy levels

**Memo says (lines 25–26):** "Admin (levels 1–4) — decreasing power/control top-down. No hard cap yet."

**Existing docs (ARCHITECTURE_BRAIN.md:49–60):** Lists 8 personae (Estate Manager, Junior Leasing, Junior Maintenance, Junior Finance, Junior Compliance, Junior Communications, Coworker, Migration Wizard) but does NOT spell out "Admin levels 1–4" hierarchy.

**Issue:** Unclear whether "Admin 1–4" is a separate hierarchy from the "Junior" personae, or whether "Junior" roles should be renamed/restructured to align with "Admin 1–4".

**Decision needed:** Is "Admin 1–4" a config-level hierarchy to be added, or should the existing 8 personae be the source of truth?

---

### CONFLICT 2: Tenant app universality vs. multi-org isolation

**Memo says (lines 136–139):** "Tenant app is universal, not org-siloed. One download, access many organizations. Tenant can hold simultaneous tenancies across multiple orgs. To join TRC's portfolio, tenant receives/enters a special code from TRC."

**Existing docs (CUSTOMER_APP.md, DOMAIN_MODEL.md):** Models a single tenant-to-org binding per app session. No mention of multi-org tenant identity, special-code onboarding, or simultaneous tenancies.

**Issue:** Implementing universal tenant app with multi-org support is a significant architecture change. Current Customer App design assumes single-org isolation.

**Decision needed:** Prioritize multi-org tenant identity refactor, or defer to Phase 2?

---

### CONFLICT 3: Configurable geo-hierarchy vs. fixed location model

**Memo says (lines 76–78):** "Elastic geo-hierarchy (CRITICAL) — Do NOT force a fixed region → district → village structure. TRC's convention: Districts contain Regions (counter-intuitive to global convention)."

**Existing docs (DOMAIN_MODEL.md):** Models location as fixed "property location" fields. No mention of org-configurable hierarchy labels or N-deep nesting.

**Issue:** Allowing arbitrary hierarchy labels and inversion (Districts > Regions) requires a tree/graph model, not flat location fields.

**Decision needed:** Refactor location model to support N-deep, org-configurable hierarchy, or limit initial scope to TRC's specific (Districts > Regions) pattern?

---

## Top 10 NOT_COVERED Directives (Highest Priority to Design Next)

1. **Tenant app universal + multi-org support (Section 4)** — Major architectural gap; requires identity and session redesign
2. **Elastic geo-hierarchy with org-configurable labels (Section 2)** — Critical for TRC and similar large organizations with unique geographic conventions
3. **AI price-negotiation engine (Section 4)** — Required for marketplace intelligence; no negotiation protocol documented
4. **Conditional survey report generation with action plans (Section 7 + 13)** — Pain point elimination; core value driver for TRC
5. **GePG payment integration + Tanzanian compliance (Section 6)** — Tanzania-specific; required for full payment automation
6. **Arrears ledger + interactive verification (Section 6)** — "Biggest operational stressor"; revenue-critical
7. **Nanobanana document generation integration (Section 5 + 8)** — State-of-the-art document creation; mentioned by founder
8. **Asset subdivision + parcel genealogy tracking (Section 2 + 3)** — First-class feature; complex domain logic
9. **Sublease permission workflow (Section 10)** — Common dispute trigger; needs workflow automation
10. **Damage-deduction negotiation + evidence bundling (Section 9 + 10)** — Dispute resolution; requires evidence chain and negotiation surface

## Summary of Recommendations

### Fully Covered (18 directives) — Low Risk
- Owner control and account deletion
- Estate Manager persona
- EMU as Owner mapping
- Core pain points (revenue loss, double-leasing)
- Future vision goals (TRC's stated outcomes)

### Partially Covered (24 directives) — Medium Risk
- Most approval-flow and role-hierarchy concepts exist but lack detail (e.g., admin levels, conditional routing rules)
- Data migration and OCR exist but lack LPMS-specific auto-mapping
- Payment and maintenance flows exist but lack full feature details (gamification, credit-scoring, AI mediation)

### Not Covered (15 directives) — High Risk
- Multi-org tenant identity and universal app
- Elastic geo-hierarchy with configurable labels
- AI price-negotiation, damage-deduction negotiation, cost-assessment mediation
- GePG + Tanzanian compliance integration
- Asset subdivision and parcel genealogy
- Document-chat interface
- Nanobanana integration

### Conflicts (3) — Requires Founder Alignment
- Admin 1–4 hierarchy vs. existing 8 personae
- Universal tenant app vs. single-org isolation
- Elastic geo-hierarchy vs. fixed location model

---

## Next Steps

1. **Align on conflicts** — Founder decision on Admin hierarchy, multi-org tenant identity, and geo-hierarchy scope
2. **Prioritize NOT_COVERED directives** — Top 10 list above; recommend phased delivery with TRC pain-point priorities (geo-hierarchy, conditional survey, arrears, GePG)
3. **Spike on SOTA research questions** — Assign ownership for property-class taxonomy, gamification patterns, move-out workflows, bad-history thresholds
4. **Update docs in phases** — Do not attempt to document all gaps at once; focus on implementation-ready specs for Phase 1 (geo-hierarchy, conditional survey, arrears)
