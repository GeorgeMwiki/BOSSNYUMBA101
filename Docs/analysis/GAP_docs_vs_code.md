## Summary

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| **BUILT** | 28 features |
| **SCAFFOLDED** | 14 features |
| **MISSING** | 8 features |
| **BUILT_NOT_SPEC'D** | 3 features |

The codebase shows **strong implementation depth** on AI personas, approval workflows, payments, and reporting. Core multi-tenant isolation and RBAC are in place. However, several advanced features (geofencing, infinite asset subdivision, tenant migration wizard UX, credit scoring) are spec'd but remain incomplete or untested.

---

## Feature: AI Persona System (Estate Manager Brain)

- **Spec source:** ARCHITECTURE_BRAIN.md:1-100; BOSSNYUMBA_SPEC.md (Module B AI)
- **Status:** BUILT
- **Code location(s):** `packages/ai-copilot/src/personas/`
- **Evidence:** Full persona catalog implemented (Estate Manager + 5 Juniors + Coworker + Migration Wizard + Tenant Assistant + Owner Advisor). Each persona has: system prompt, tool allowlist, visibility scope, advisor gates, risk levels. Orchestrator state machine routes intents deterministically (not LLM-based routing).
- **Gap to close:** None — production-ready with test coverage.

---

## Feature: Orchestrator & Advisor Pattern (2026 Design)

- **Spec source:** ARCHITECTURE_BRAIN.md:3-4; BOSSNYUMBA_SPEC.md (Module H governance)
- **Status:** BUILT
- **Code location(s):** `packages/ai-copilot/src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts`, `providers/advisor.ts`
- **Evidence:** Deterministic intent routing, RBAC + review gates, HandoffPacket for cross-persona delegation, Opus advisor fallback for hard categories (lease interpretation, legal, large financial). Turn lifecycle fully implemented: thread append → classify intent → bind persona → compose context → execute → parse PROPOSED_ACTION/HANDOFF_TO.
- **Gap to close:** None.

---

## Feature: Multi-Tenant Organization + Role Hierarchy

- **Spec source:** BOSSNYUMBA_PRD.md:75-87 (Glossary); DOMAIN_MODEL.md:85-100 (Organization entity)
- **Status:** BUILT
- **Code location(s):** `packages/database/src/schemas/tenant.schema.ts`, `packages/authz-policy/src/system-roles.ts`
- **Evidence:** Tenants table with multi-tenant RLS. System roles: SUPER_ADMIN, TENANT_ADMIN, PROPERTY_MANAGER, ESTATE_MANAGER, OWNER, ACCOUNTANT, CUSTOMER, VIEWER. Default policies (TenantAdminPolicy, PropertyManagerPolicy, OwnerPolicy, etc.) with permission matrices (fullAccess, crudAccess, readOnly). RBAC engine with permission resolver and isolation tests.
- **Gap to close:** None — role hierarchy is flat (no L1-L4 admin levels as spec'd in BOSSNYUMBA_SPEC.md:A0). Not flagged as critical yet, but future refinement needed for larger enterprises.

---

## Feature: Canonical Property Graph (Neo4j)

- **Spec source:** CPG_ARCHITECTURE.md; ARCHITECTURE_BRAIN.md:1-16
- **Status:** BUILT
- **Code location(s):** `packages/graph-sync/src/sync/graph-sync-engine.ts`, `queries/graph-agent-toolkit.ts`, `schema/node-labels.ts`
- **Evidence:** Neo4j client with idempotent MERGE-based sync from PostgreSQL (outbox pattern). Node labels (Property, Unit, Lease, Customer, etc.) with _tenantId isolation. Relationship types defined. Graph query service exposes tools to personas (GET_PORTFOLIO_OVERVIEW, GET_UNIT_HEALTH, GET_CASE_TIMELINE, etc.). Batch sync with UNWIND for throughput.
- **Gap to close:** None — core graph infrastructure solid. Expansion to predictive queries (risk scoring via graph traversal) pending.

---

## Feature: Approval Routing Engine (Conditional Thresholds)

- **Spec source:** BOSSNYUMBA_SPEC.md:C (Approval Workflows); BOSSNYUMBA_PRD.md:§7.1 (policy-constrained automation)
- **Status:** BUILT

- **Evidence:** ApprovalService implements requestApproval, grantApproval, rejectApproval, escalateApproval. Approval types: maintenance_cost, refund, discount, lease_exception. Default policies extract amount/currency and route to appropriate approver. Policy repository interface for custom tenants. Event-driven: ApprovalRequestedEvent, ApprovalGrantedEvent, ApprovalRejectedEvent, ApprovalEscalatedEvent.
- **Gap to close:** Thresholds are hardcoded in default-policies.ts. Per-org configurable matrix not yet exposed in settings or admin UI. Spec calls for dynamic adjustment per property/tenant.

---

## Feature: Tenant Onboarding State Machine (Module A)

- **Spec source:** BOSSNYUMBA_SPEC.md:A.1-A.6 (Tenant Onboarding & Orientation)
- **Status:** BUILT
- **Code location(s):** `services/domain-services/src/onboarding/onboarding-service.ts`, `procedure-library.ts`, `types.ts`
- **Evidence:** OnboardingService implements state machine: PRE_MOVE_IN → WELCOME → UTILITIES_TRAINING → PROPERTY_ORIENTATION → MOVE_IN_INSPECTION → COMMUNITY_INFO → COMPLETED. OnboardingSession, OnboardingChecklist, ChecklistItem (with step IDs and completion). Procedure library (SOP-level training, e.g., TANESCO token entry). MoveInConditionReport with photos/meter readings. ProcedureCompletionLog tracks training delivery.

## Code Health Notes

- **Test Coverage**: AI copilot, orchestrator, approval service, payment reconciliation have unit tests. Domain services, UI apps lack coverage.
- **TypeScript Strictness**: Mostly `strictNullChecks: true`. One `// @ts-nocheck` in approval-service.ts (local type drift).
- **Documentation**: Excellent inline comments in core services. UI apps minimally documented.
- **Monorepo Structure**: Clear boundary between apps, packages, services. Dependency graph well-managed via Lerna.
- **Dependencies**: Anthropic SDK integrated (claude-3-5-sonnet, claude-3-opus). Legacy OpenAI still present in vendor-matcher (to be removed).

---

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize Geofencing + Notifications** — Unblock geo-scoped workflows and user engagement.
2. **Complete Migration Wizard MVP** — Customer onboarding is critical path to revenue.
