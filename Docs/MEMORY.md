# BossNyumba Memory — Long-Lived Assistant Context

**Last Updated:** 2026-05-22 (post Wave 28+ wave-4 — providers, perf
indexes, owner backend, a11y, memory layer, UI-1..5, P-6..10)

This file holds long-lived context that any LLM-based assistant
(Claude Code, Cursor, IDE extensions) should load on every fresh
session. Keep entries to one line under ~200 chars where possible.
Move detail into topic files referenced from here.

## Project identity

- **BossNyumba** = this repo. AI-native multi-tenant property-
  management SaaS for East Africa.
- **PROJECT_BOUNDARY.md** is canonical: never reference Pongezi or
  any other project in code, docs, or config.
- Tanzania-first defaults (TZS), pan-African ambitions (KES, UGX,
  ZAR also supported). Never hard-code jurisdiction / currency /
  locale in business logic — users choose their display currency,
  resolved via `user → tenant → platform-default` chain.

## Current wave state — Wave 28+

Production hardening + AI brain power-up. The brain (central-
intelligence + ai-copilot) is wired through api-gateway composition.
Wave-4 within Wave 28 closed real provider adapters, perf indexes,
owner backend skeletons, a11y, and security follow-ups (see
[`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md)).

### Recent CL pointers

- **Piece A — Universal Asset & Entity Model (Wave 16 master plan)** —
  polymorphic `core_entity` + 6 thin per-type extensions
  (land/building/vehicle/machinery/it_asset/person) + tenant-defined
  custom fields registry + backward-compat `properties_view` /
  `units_view`. Migrations
  `packages/database/src/migrations/0186_core_entity.sql` ..
  `0194_entity_ext_person.sql`. Repository:
  `packages/database/src/repositories/core-entity.repository.ts`.
  Codemap: [`Docs/CODEMAPS/core-entity.md`](./CODEMAPS/core-entity.md).
- **Memory layer (CL-9)** — Drizzle schemas + MMR rerank + drift
  detection. Migration `packages/database/src/migrations/0181_memory_layer.sql`.
- **BFF aggregation (CL-4)** — 7 routers rewritten under
  `services/api-gateway/src/routes/bff/`.
- **Perf indexes (CL-5)** — `0179_missing_tenant_indexes.sql`,
  `0180_perf_indexes.sql`.
- **UI-1..5** — adaptive layout (`packages/dynamic-sections/`),
  ProactiveHint + MasteryGate + LearnedShortcutsPanel
  (`packages/chat-ui/src/components/`), `user_action_tracker` table
  (`0183_user_action_tracker.sql`), `section_layouts` table
  (`0182_section_layouts.sql`).
- **P-6..10 brain power** — Tree-of-Thoughts planner, smart memory
  retrieval, Haiku-first cascade, eval-on-traffic + adversarial
  corpus, multi-agent debate-default at stakes≥high (all under
  `packages/central-intelligence/src/kernel/`).
- **Money path (CL-BUGS)** — 5 CRITICAL closed in payments-ledger.
- **Piece D — persona runtime** (`packages/persona-runtime/`): five
  power tiers (OWNER/ADMIN/MANAGER/EMPLOYEE/CUSTOMER), seven built-in
  personas, tool-catalog filter pipeline, scope-predicate evaluator,
  binding resolver. Migrations `0195..0199`. Tenants relabel via the
  `titles` table; the brain routes on `power_tier`, never the label.
- **Piece F — conversation threads** (`packages/conversation-threads/`):
  MD-tier projects (gate `power_tier ≤ 3`), threads with SHA-256
  hash-chained messages, versioned artifacts (branch supported),
  cross-thread retrieval scoped to (tenant, persona, project), WhatsApp
  24h-window session rotation. Migrations `0200..0204`.
- **Piece G — GenUI inline artifacts** (`packages/genui/`,
  `services/api-gateway/src/routes/artifacts.hono.ts`): 32-type
  catalog (kpi_tile, charts, table, form, deck_slide, doc_section,
  …), `<UiArtifact>` typed-streaming renderer, server-side render
  to PNG/PDF/SVG via Playwright. Migrations `0205..0207`. Brain
  may only emit pre-registered catalog keys — no raw JSX/HTML.
- **Piece H — Reports + Decks + Socratic tutor** —
  `packages/report-engine/` (PDF/DOCX/PPTX, 7 built-in templates),
  `packages/presentation-engine/` (5 built-in themes, Piece-G
  artifact-compatible), `packages/tutoring-skill-pack/`
  (data-grounded Socratic tutor, 10 built-in concepts). Migrations
  `0208_report_templates.sql`, `0209_presentation_themes.sql`,
  `0210_tutoring_skill_pack.sql`. All three tables: tenant_id NULL
  = platform built-in (SELECT escape via NULL); writes are
  tenant-scoped via RLS.
- **Piece K — Document analysis pipeline** (`packages/document-analysis/`):
  ingest → OCR (Tesseract EN+SW) → layout → semantic extract → entity
  resolve → tab routing → citation. 9-doc-type taxonomy maps to the
  same routing matrix as Piece L's chat capture. Migrations
  `0211_documents.sql`, `0212_document_extractions.sql`,
  `0213_document_entities.sql`, `0214_document_routing.sql`.
  `0215_document_entities_core_entity_fk.sql` adds the deferred FK to
  `core_entity` (was a soft TEXT pointer in K's worktree pre-merge).
- **Piece L — Brain↔Tab Loop architecture** —
  `Docs/architecture/PIECE_L_BRAIN_TAB_LOOP.md` (design doc only;
  implementation lands in Wave 22 with migrations `0228..0231`):
  capture → dispatch → accept_proposal → tab update. Routing matrix is
  data not code; HITL gating below 0.78 confidence; identical
  proposal shape regardless of source (chat vs doc upload).
- **Wave 15 — TRC EMU pilot** (`scripts/seed-trc-tenant.mjs`,
  `services/api-gateway/src/workers/lease-expiry-alert-cron.ts`):
  TRC tenant + 4 districts + 15 stations + 30 units + 5 leases + 8
  users (DG @ T1, 2× EMU @ T3, 5× lessees @ T5), GePG round-trip
  verifier, daily lease-expiry alert cron over 60/30/7/1-day windows.

## Hard invariants (NEVER violate)

- **Money path goes through `LedgerService.post()`** — direct ledger
  writes break the immutable double-entry invariant.
- **RLS is FORCE-enabled on every tenant-scoped table** — `app.current_
  tenant_id` GUC bound by `services/api-gateway/src/middleware/`.
  Never disable RLS, never double-filter from app code.
- **Supabase JWT is canonical auth** — no Clerk imports anywhere.
- **HIGH-risk policy prefixes** (sovereign / kill_switch / four_eye
  / policy_rollout) must hit literal policy rules; no reason-resolver
  generalisation.
- **Kill-switch fail-closed** — never catch + ignore its errors.
- **Webhook delivery is at-least-once** — consumers MUST be
  idempotent (use `Idempotency-Key`).
- **AI audit chain is hash-chained, append-only** — no mutation.
- **Predictions APPEND to rule-based decisions** — never replace.
- **Migrations are immutable** — never edit a shipped numbered file.
- **OTel bootstrap runs first** in `services/api-gateway/src/index.ts`
  before any module emits spans.
- **Multi-currency**: every money render uses
  `formatCurrency(amount, currencyCode)`; never hard-code KES / TZS.
- **Memory recall is tier-scoped at fetch time**. Sovereign /
  litfin-admin equivalents see aggregated, PII-stripped branches.

## Anti-patterns observed (do not reintroduce)

- `console.log` in services — Pino logger only.
- Reflective CORS — origin allowlist only.
- Raw HTML interpolation — DOMPurify wraps required.
- Reading `process.env` outside bootstrap.
- Bypassing api-gateway with direct Supabase queries from clients.
- Importing one Hono route handler from another — compose via
  service-registry instead.
- Disabling RLS for performance — fix the index instead.
- Hard-coded `KES` / `TZS` in app code.
- Editing a shipped migration file.

## Conventions

- Conventional commits: `feat: / fix: / refactor: / chore: / docs:`.
- 80%+ test coverage required; TDD encouraged (write tests first).
- File size <800 lines, function <50 lines, no nesting >4 levels.
- Immutability (no mutation of inputs); zod for runtime validation.
- next-intl v4 for i18n; nodemailer v8 for email.
- Drizzle ORM only (Prisma fully removed from payments-ledger in
  Wave 2 L).
- New routes: `*.hono.ts` convention; older `*.router.ts` deprecated.
