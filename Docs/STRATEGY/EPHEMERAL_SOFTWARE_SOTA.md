# EPHEMERAL_SOFTWARE_SOTA — Software becomes a derived runtime output

> **Founder directive (verbatim):** *"Every function can generate its own dashboards

> be generated, discarded and regenerated. Deep online research here. We need to be SOTA."*

This is an investor-grade master document. It explains why the next paradigm of
business software is not "software you write, deploy, and maintain", but **software
your domain functions generate on demand, the operator uses briefly, and the runtime
discards** — regenerated differently the next time the context shifts. It cites the
SOTA landscape across 15+ sources, documents what no incumbent has yet combined, and
explains why Mr. Mwikila — Boss Nyumba's single mind — is positioned to ship the
first defensible implementation in production for African property-management
tenants.

## 1. The paradigm shift

For sixty years, software has been an **artifact** — a thing engineers build, ship,
maintain, and version. The UI is a separate codebase from the domain logic. A
dashboard is a file. A form is a component. The act of using software is the act of
walking into a pre-built room. If the room does not suit your task, you wait two
quarters for the next sprint to build a new room. If you are a property manager
running ten buildings in a forgotten market, you wait forever.

Generative AI cracks this open. When the cost of producing a working UI drops from
"days of engineering" to "milliseconds of inference", the artifact model itself
becomes uneconomic. Andrej Karpathy captured the shift bluntly in his 2025
year-in-review when he described "vibe coding entire ephemeral apps just to find a
single bug because why not — code is suddenly free, ephemeral, malleable, discardable
after single use" ([catalaize.substack.com, 2025](https://catalaize.substack.com/p/andrej-karpathy-software-is-changing)).
Karpathy's accompanying disclaimer — *"Code is ephemeral now and libraries are
over"* — is not poetry. It is the new pricing model.

The opposite of the artifact model is the **runtime-output** model. The same domain
function that today returns a JSON payload (e.g. `project_arrears(building, q3)`)
tomorrow returns a **runtime-composed dashboard** — chart, table, recommendation,
copy, locale, brand tokens, scope-appropriate redactions — produced fresh from the
function's output plus the operator's current context, lived briefly, discarded when
the operator closes the tab, regenerated differently when the context changes.

This is **software as a derived runtime output** of (function, context). It is what
the Ink & Switch malleable-software essay calls "a software ecosystem that smooths
the transition between using software and creating software" ([Ink & Switch, June
2025](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/malleable-software/)). It is what Anthropic
prototypes through Artifacts ([anthropic.com](https://www.anthropic.com/news/artifacts)).
It is what tldraw whispers through Make Real ([tldraw, 2024](https://makereal.tldraw.com/)).
None of them ship the complete loop. We will.

Boss Nyumba's bet is that for property managers in African markets — who *cannot*
wait for global SaaS vendors to model their lease law, their language, their
maintenance vendor network, their tenancy-risk heuristics — **the only software that
arrives in time is software that generates itself in time**. Mr. Mwikila is that
software.

---

## 2. The principle

Every function carries a latent UI manifest.

A pure domain function — say `project_arrears(building_id, quarter)` in
`packages/arrears-advisor/` — is conventionally a typed function that returns a
typed result. Under the ephemeral-software model, the same function additionally
declares a **`FunctionUIManifest`**: a tiny descriptor that says *"my output is best
visualised as a chart-with-table dashboard, sized for an owner reviewing on a
laptop, with brand-locked OKLCH colors from the bossnyumba token set, emphasis on
narrative not data density, and the manifest is ephemeral by default with a 5-minute
cache window"*.

The composer reads the function's output, the manifest, and the operator's full
context (scope, mastery tier, locale, recent turns, memory recall, brand DNA), and
emits a **`TabRecipe`** — the same contract `packages/dynamic-ui/` already speaks —
on the fly. The TabRecipe is rendered, the operator uses it, the tab is closed, and
the recipe is discarded. The next time the operator asks the same kind of question,
the function is called again, the manifest is read again, the composer runs again
with the operator's *new* context, and a *different* recipe is produced — because
the context has changed.

The artifact is gone. The capability remains.

---

## 3. Five properties of ephemeral software

### 3.1 Function-attached

Every domain function declares its dashboard archetype. There is no separate UI
codebase to maintain. When `project_arrears` is renamed, refactored, deleted, or
its output shape changed, the manifest moves with the function. Manifests live in
the same git commit as the function they describe. The UI never drifts from the
domain — because the UI does not exist between requests.

This is the inversion of the Retool pattern. Retool's AppGen ([retool.com,
2024](https://retool.com/blog/ai-generated-apps)) generates apps from natural
language and your schema, but the generated apps are then *saved as artifacts* that
must be maintained. Boss Nyumba generates apps too — but **discards them after
use** and regenerates next time. There is no "version skew" between the UI and the
function because there is no UI version.

### 3.2 Context-aware

The same function produces different UIs for different operators in different
situations. An owner of a residential block who asks "show me Q3 arrears" sees
a narrative-first dashboard with the property-manager's recommendations and a
one-click "issue formal demand" action. A maintenance lead with no financial
authority sees the same numbers rendered as a read-only context panel inside their
incident view. An auditor sees a compliance view with citations to the lease
clauses and the hash-chain links.

Context-awareness is what makes ephemeral software better than persistent software,
not just cheaper. A pre-built dashboard cannot be all those things at once; it must
pick one and force the other two into "show all, hide nothing" or "show all, hide
some via permissions". Ephemeral software composes the right view in the moment.

This is the principle Hex Magic gestures at ([hex.tech, fall
2025](https://hex.tech/blog/fall-2025-launch/)) when its Threads agent takes a
natural-language question and returns a dashboard rather than a pre-built artifact.
The difference is that Hex stops at "data team gets a dashboard"; we go further to
*"the same function gives owner, manager, vendor, tenant their own scope-appropriate
view, every time"*.

### 3.3 Discarded by default

Closing the tab discards the generated UI. There is no implicit save. There is no
"recents" list. There is no version that persists to long-term storage.

This is the property that lets the system stay fast and stay honest. If the UI is
persistent, it must be maintained — which means engineering hours, version skew,
brand drift, and the slow ossification that turns every property-management SaaS
dashboard into a museum of "previous quarter's idea of what mattered". If the UI is
discarded by default, none of that happens. The cost of being wrong is zero.

The Indigo AI essay "The End of Permanent UI" frames the same thesis: *"At runtime
we will have apps conjure from nothing and then simply fade away."*
([getindigo.ai](https://www.getindigo.ai/blog/the-end-of-permanent-ui)).
Persistence is the exception, not the default — and we will make it explicit.

### 3.4 Regenerable

Re-opening regenerates from the current state, not from cached pixels. If the
operator asked the same question twice in a row, the second answer would compose
from the same function output and the same context — but the composer is permitted
to choose a different presentation, and indeed *should*, if anything in the context
moved.

This is the inversion of "screenshot a dashboard and pin it to Slack". The screenshot
is dead data. The regenerated dashboard is **live data through live judgement**.
The Live Activities pattern Apple introduced in iOS 18 ([Apple Developer Human
Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/live-activities))
hints at this: the same activity refreshes with the latest state every time it is
shown, in a layout that adapts to the surface — Dynamic Island, Lock Screen,
CarPlay, Apple Watch. Boss Nyumba generalises Apple's surface-adaptation pattern
to a full domain-function adaptation: not just "render this state on this screen",
but "compose the right interface for this question, this person, this moment".

### 3.5 Learnable

High-reuse generated UIs get promoted to **learned recipes** via the existing
lock-improve cycle.

This is the move no one else has made publicly. Vercel v0 ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/blog/announcing-v0-generative-ui))
generates code on every request — but the code is the artifact, not the manifest;
the generation does not feed back into a registry of patterns that "deserve to be
persisted because operators kept asking for them". Cursor Composer 2.5 ([cursor.com,
May 2026](https://cursor.com/blog/composer-2-5)) excels at agentic code generation
but does not telemetrically promote successful generations into reusable assets.

Boss Nyumba does. When the same generated pattern (`(function_id,
generated_recipe_hash)` shape) is reused ≥10 times across ≥3 different users in a
tenant, the system promotes it from "ephemeral" to a static `TabRecipe` in the
registry. From then on, the recipe is loaded instead of generated, can be locked,
A/B tested, and improved via the improve loop. The unified cognitive memory makes
the promotion decisions cross-tenant when federation thresholds are satisfied: a
pattern that proved valuable for ten residential blocks can be offered to the
eleventh on first run.

Software is ephemeral by default. It becomes durable by *earning durability through
use*.

**Two further corroborating sources** worth naming for completeness:

- **Maisem on "Ephemeral Software"** ([maisem.dev](https://maisem.dev/blog/ephemeral)): "The codebase is at most cached and can be discarded and regenerated with high trust. If software generation cost approaches zero, software maintenance looks like a waste of time." — short post, names the economic shift.
- **Indigo AI on "The End of Permanent UI"** ([getindigo.ai](https://www.getindigo.ai/blog/the-end-of-permanent-ui)): coins **"Ephemeral UI"** as "user interfaces generated on demand, used for a task, then gone. When you close the window, the interface ceases to exist."

The pattern across all fifteen: **everyone has one or two of the five properties; nobody combines all five inside a multi-tenant runtime with brand-lock, authority tiers, and learning.** That is the gap.

---

## 5. What is defensible about Boss Nyumba's approach

Five existing pillars combine into a moat:

1. **Unified cognitive memory** means a generated UI is not a one-shot — it can
   recall every prior generation for the same `(function_id, archetype, scope)`
   tuple across the tenant's history (and, with federation, across all tenants),
   and lean toward presentations that *worked*. Vercel v0 generates each time
   from a fresh prompt; our generator generates from a fresh prompt **plus an
   embedding-indexed recall of every dashboard the tenant has ever seen and
   reacted to**. ([UNIFIED_COGNITIVE_MEMORY_SPEC](../DESIGN/UNIFIED_COGNITIVE_MEMORY_SPEC.md))

2. **Org-scope hierarchy** means the same function call from the same user can
   produce a tenant-customised UI without leaking another tenant's patterns.
   Hex Magic does not have this — its workspace context is shared across
   collaborators. Boss Nyumba's scope hierarchy lets `compose_dashboard` know
   that this particular request is "owner of Riara Towers, scoped to Block A, in
   the Q3 fiscal window" — and routes templates, copy, brand tokens, and
   federated recall accordingly.

3. **Brand DNA + ESLint brand-lock** means **every generated UI passes through
   the `bossnyumba/no-non-token-style` rule at composition time**. A raw hex
   color in a generated component is rejected and the composer regenerates with
   the `BossNyumbaBrandConstraint` injected explicitly. v0 cannot do this — it
   has no project-level brand-lock pipeline. Our generated UIs are physically
   incapable of shipping off-brand pixels.

4. **Mutation authority + approval matrix** means a generated UI cannot silently
   introduce a Tier-2 action button. Authority is enforced at the manifest
   level: a function declaring `authority_tier: 0` may compose into an inline
   tab; a function declaring `authority_tier: 2` (e.g. `commit_eviction_notice`)
   composes into a UI whose *submit* surface is auto-routed through the
   approval matrix. No incumbent has this combination of "AI generates UI" +
   "AI cannot bypass the org's authority discipline".

5. **Audit-hash chain** (`@bossnyumba/audit-hash-chain`) means every generated
   UI carries an audit-hash record of *what was composed, for whom, from what
   context, when, and what they did with it*. The hash chain is tamper-evident
   (sha256, secret-rotated, verifiable offline). When a Kenyan rent tribunal
   asks *"how did this manager decide to issue this notice on this date?"*,
   the audit chain shows the function, the generated dashboard, the citations
   surfaced in the UI, and the click history. No SaaS competitor in the
   African property-management space — let alone v0 / Cursor / Hex — has this.

The investor read: this is not "v0 for Africa". This is **v0's generation primitive,
inside an audit-grade multi-tenant runtime, governed by a learned memory and a
brand-lock pipeline, gated by an authority matrix, observable end-to-end** — built
for an industry where the artifact model has failed the smallest property managers
for fifty years. It is not portable to the v0 model in the other direction; it is
the *next* generation of enterprise software, and Boss Nyumba ships it first (with
Borjie as the hard-fork sibling) because the African property-management domain
*demands* it.

## 6. What this enables — concrete examples

### Example A — Owner asks "show me Q3 arrears on Riara Towers"

1. Mr. Mwikila's intent recogniser classifies the turn → `intent =
   query_arrears`.
2. The cognitive engine routes to `project_arrears(tenant=riara_towers,
   quarter=Q3-2026)` in `packages/arrears-advisor/`.
3. The function returns `{ arrears: [...], suggested_actions: [...],
   confidence: 0.86 }`.
4. The function's `FunctionUIManifest` says: `archetype = chart_with_table`,
   `emphasis = narrative`, `preferred_size = tab`, `mobile_strategy = simplify`,
   `authority_tier = 1`, `ephemeral_by_default = true`, `cache_ttl_seconds = 300`.
5. `composeDashboardForFunction(manifest, output, user_context)` reads the
   owner's mastery tier (`expert`), locale (`en`), brand tokens, and a cognitive-
   memory recall of two prior Q-end arrears dashboards the owner reacted
   positively to.
6. It emits a TabRecipe: an explanation paragraph in Mr. Mwikila's voice, a
   bar-chart of unit arrears, a table with suggested per-tenant actions, a
   primary action `Issue formal demand letter` (Tier 1, surfaces approval
   matrix).
7. Owner reviews. Closes the tab. Recipe is discarded. Telemetry row written.
8. Next month, owner asks the same question with a different framing — *"who's
   behind on rent in Block A this month?"*. Same function, different
   context (focused intent + recent maintenance turns in memory) → composer
   emits a *different* recipe: a single big-number KPI for total overdue, a
   sparkline for the trend, no table. Better fit. Still ephemeral.
9. After the 10th such request across the owner's three buildings, the
   promotion-decider lifts the pattern into a learned `TabRecipe` —
   `arrears-quarterly-owner-en` — which now loads from the registry and
   enters the lock/improve cycle.

### Example B — Maintenance lead asks "what units had incidents this week?"

Function `query_incident_units(building_id, week)` → returns a list of units with
metadata. Manifest: `archetype = list_with_filters`, `emphasis = actionable`.
Composer generates a filterable list with drill-down to each incident's audit
chain. Lead closes — discarded. Next month, same question — generated again
with the latest data + the lead's filtering habits in memory.

### Example C — Prospective tenant asks "which Riara units fit my $800 budget?"

Function `match_tenant_budget(prospect_id, threshold)` in
`packages/leasing-advisor/` → returns matching listings. Manifest: `archetype =
list_with_filters` + `composite` layout (map overlay), `emphasis = data_density`.
Composer generates a marketplace tab with map markers + a unit table + an
"apply for viewing" button (Tier 0). Prospect browses, closes tab. Discarded.

### Example D — Auditor asks "show me Block A's deposit-trust ledger"

Same underlying function `query_deposit_ledger(building_id, range)` — but the
auditor's context (`scope = audit`, mastery `power-user`) routes the composer
to emit a citations-heavy view, with every row linking to its audit-hash and
its source lease-clause citation. The owner of Block A invoking the same
function gets the narrative version. Same function. Two different rooms,
composed in real time.

---

## 7. Risks

1. **UI inconsistency between sessions.** If the composer is too creative, the
   operator never sees the same dashboard twice and trust collapses. *Mitigation:*
   the cognitive-memory recall is the stabiliser — when an operator's recent
   interactions show high engagement with archetype X for question Y, the composer
   anchors to X with mild variation, not radical reinvention. Promotion to a
   learned recipe at the 10×3 threshold further stabilises high-frequency patterns.

2. **Performance.** Composing on every request is slower than serving a static
   asset. *Mitigation:* the cache policy (5 min for ephemeral default, 1 hour for
   high-reuse non-default, invalidated on context change) keeps p95 under a tab's
   patience window. The composer runs server-side; the rendered TabRecipe streams
   over the existing dynamic-ui rail.

3. **Accessibility.** Generated UIs can ship WCAG violations. *Mitigation:* the
   archetype renderers only emit UiPart payloads from the brand-locked primitive
   set — which already passes axe-core CI gates today. The composer cannot
   invent a new HTML element.

4. **Brand drift.** Generated UIs could emit off-brand colors or non-token
   spacings. *Mitigation:* the brand-lock pass runs after composition; the
   `bossnyumba/no-non-token-style` rule rejects any recipe with non-token
   styling; composer regenerates with `BossNyumbaBrandConstraint` injected.
   Three retries; then fail loud.

5. **Debugging difficulty.** When something looks wrong in an ephemeral UI, the
   engineer cannot "git blame the component". *Mitigation:* the audit-hash row
   stores `(function_id, manifest_version, generated_recipe_hash, user_context_hash,
   composer_version)` — replay is deterministic from those five fields. Every
   ephemeral UI is reproducible from its row.

6. **Memory bloat.** Discard-by-default does not happen automatically — it
   requires the lifecycle controller. *Mitigation:* `ephemeral_dashboard_telemetry`
   is the only durable trace; the TabRecipe itself is never persisted (lives in
   per-tab memory + 5-min cache). Telemetry has a 90-day TTL by default.

7. **The composer hallucinating affordances.** A generated dashboard could include
   a button labelled `Issue eviction notice` that maps to no real action.
   *Mitigation:* the archetype renderer only allows action wiring through
   declared `manifest.allowed_actions` — actions the function explicitly opted
   into. A generated button with no manifest-declared backing is rejected at
   composition time.

## 8. Six-month rollout

| Month | Stage | What ships |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Foundation | This spec + `packages/ephemeral-ui/` (ported from Borjie) + 1 migration. Manifest registry, composer skeleton, archetype renderer for `list_with_filters` + `chart_with_table` + `kpi_grid`. Brand-lock pass wired. No promotion yet. |
| 2 | Read-only generated UIs | Three pilot functions in `packages/arrears-advisor`, `packages/leasing-advisor`, `packages/maintenance-orchestrator` declare manifests. Composer renders read-only views inside chat-ui tabs. Telemetry written. Audit-hash links. |
| 3 | Interactive generated UIs | Manifest extension to declare `allowed_actions`. Composer wires action submission through existing approval-matrix. Authority-tier 0 + 1 supported. Tier 2 surfaced but routed to ApprovalGate. |
| 4 | Learning loop | Reuse counter + promotion decider live. Patterns crossing the 10×3 threshold promote to learned `TabRecipe`s in the existing registry. Lock/improve cycle now operates on promoted recipes. |
| 5 | Federated memory integration | Cognitive memory recall feeds composer with cross-tenant patterns (PII-stripped). Generated UIs for new tenants benefit from the federated catalogue. |
| 6 | Audit + tribunal readiness | Replay-from-audit-row tooling. Hash-chain verification CLI ships. First Kenyan rent tribunal pilot — auditor asks a question, the generated audit-view is hash-chain-verifiable end to end. |

Stage gates: each month, a lock review confirms the prior month's manifests +
archetypes are stable before extending. No new manifests ship without a
brand-lock test + a composer telemetry test.

## 9. Open research questions

1. **What should be ephemeral vs. persistent by default?** Heuristic: data-read
   functions ephemeral; mutation-commit functions persistent (operators must be
   able to refer back to "what I committed yesterday"). But the boundary is
   fuzzy — a "scheduled rent-roll report" is between the two. Open.

2. **How do we cache for performance without losing "regenerate on context
   change"?** Today's heuristic: cache keyed on `(function_id, function_input_hash,
   user_context_hash, brand_tokens_version)`. Open question: how granular should
   `user_context_hash` be? Including recent_turns means almost no cache hit;
   excluding them means stale UI when context shifts mid-conversation.

3. **What composer model is right?** Sonnet for default composition (cost +
   quality); Haiku for high-frequency low-risk regenerations. Opus for the
   *occasional* "novel archetype" path where the composer must reason about a
   domain shape it has not seen before. Open question: when does the composer
   escalate from Haiku → Sonnet → Opus?

4. **How does promotion interact with multi-tenant brand drift?** If pattern X is
   promoted because Riara Towers reused it 12 times, but a competing block has
   very different brand DNA — does X promote globally, or per-tenant? Initial
   answer: per-tenant; federation only via the PII-stripped pathway.

5. **Mobile-first or desktop-first generation?** The `mobile_strategy` field is a
   shortcut; the long-term answer may be that the composer generates two
   recipes (compact + full) every time, and the renderer chooses. Cost
   implications. Open.

6. **What about voice-first ephemeral UIs?** A spoken answer is an ephemeral UI
   too — Mr. Mwikila's audio reply is composed from the same function output,
   discarded after delivery, regenerable. The `ui_hints.preferred_size` may
   need a `voice` variant. Out of scope for Phase 1.

## 10. The investor pitch — one sentence

> **Boss Nyumba is the first runtime that turns every domain function into its own
> dashboard, composed in real time from the operator's context, brand-locked,
> authority-gated, audit-hash-evident, learned from every prior session — so that
> small property managers in markets the global SaaS vendors never modelled get
> SOTA-grade software the moment they ask for it, and discard it the moment they
> are done.**
