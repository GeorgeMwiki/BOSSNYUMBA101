# Model Card — LATS Tree-Search Planner v1 (F9)

**Model ID:** `lats-search-v1`
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-05-22
**Owner:** Brain team
**Jurisdiction:** Tanzania (TZ pack)
**Stakes:** High (used on high-branching, multi-step planning where Tree-of-Thoughts is insufficient)
**Status:** Production (gated behind feature flag + tier-policy)

---

## Purpose

LATS — Language-Agent Tree Search — is an alternative planner for tasks where the action space is large and outcomes uncertain (e.g., complex maintenance triage with vendor-allocation trade-offs, multi-month financial reconciliation). It complements the simpler Tree-of-Thoughts planner (P-6) and the multi-agent debate component (P-10). LATS is selected by the kernel when (a) stakes are high, (b) the action graph has > 4 distinct branches, and (c) prior plans have failed the online judge.

## Architecture

Tree search with LLM-scored node expansion. The planner:

1. Generates candidate actions at each node via an LLM call (with constrained-output schema)
2. Scores each child node using a learned heuristic + the online judge (P-9)
3. Expands the best-scoring branch using a UCT-like budget
4. Backpropagates result scores to update branch priors
5. Returns the best completed trajectory, with the full search trace logged

Trajectory + scores written to the sovereign action ledger.

## Training data

**None for the search algorithm itself.** Scoring relies on the online judge's rubric, which is versioned (see `online-judge-v1`). LLM expansion uses frozen foundation models.

## Inputs

- Task description + relevant context (tenant, property, lease, prior plans)
- Budget (max nodes, max depth, max wall-clock seconds)
- Tier from `tier-policy-resolver-v1`

## Outputs

- Best trajectory (sequence of actions)
- Full search tree (for audit + reflexion)
- Confidence score
- `escalate-to-human` if best trajectory below confidence threshold

## Performance

| Metric | Target | Last measured |
|---|---|---|
| Plan-success rate vs. ToT baseline on adversarial corpus | +15% | TODO |
| Wall-clock latency p95 | < 30 s | TODO |
| Cost per successful plan | < USD 0.50 | TODO |
| Escalate-to-human rate (correctly identified hard cases) | tracked | TODO |

## Limitations

- Expensive: orders of magnitude more LLM calls than single-pass planning; reserved for high-stakes + high-branch cases
- Score signal lags real-world outcome by hours-days; reflexion loop closes this
- Vulnerable to score-hacking by an attacker controlling task description; mitigated by tier-policy + prompt-shield (`packages/ai-copilot/src/security/prompt-shield.ts`)

## Privacy & Safety

- PII scrubbed via `packages/ai-copilot/src/security/pii-scrubber.ts` (511 lines) before any LLM expansion call
- All emitted tool calls gated by `tier-policy-resolver-v1`
- Kill-switch fail-closed; toggle in `services/api-gateway/src/composition/brain-kernel-wiring.ts`
