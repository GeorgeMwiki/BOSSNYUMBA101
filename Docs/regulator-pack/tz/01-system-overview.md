## 1. What BossNyumba is

BossNyumba is a multi-tenant, AI-native property-management platform serving residential and commercial landlords, estate management companies, tenants and back-office operations teams across East Africa. The platform digitises rent collection, lease lifecycle, maintenance dispatch, tenant communication and owner reporting, with an AI "Brain" (kernel) layered on top of an operational backbone.

The platform is **operational software, not a financial institution**: BossNyumba does not hold deposits, does not lend, does not provide investment advice, and is not a payment service provider in its own name. Rent payments flow through licensed mobile-money operators and banks (M-Pesa Tanzania, Airtel Money, TigoPesa, HaloPesa, GePG); BossNyumba is the reconciliation layer and tenant ledger of record.

Core capabilities:

| Capability | Source-of-truth path (BossNyumba monorepo) |
|---|---|
| Property + unit + lease + tenant master data | `packages/database/src/schema/` (drizzle schema) |
| Rent collection via M-Pesa STK Push, Airtel, TigoPesa, GePG | `services/payments-ledger/`, `apps/customer-app/src/components/payments/` |
| Maintenance request dispatch + vendor coordination | `services/maintenance/`, `apps/estate-manager-app/` |
| Tenant communication (in-app, WhatsApp, SMS, voice) | `services/notifications/`, `apps/customer-app/src/components/communication/` |
| Owner / investor portfolio reporting | `apps/owner-portal/`, `services/reporting/` |
| AI kernel + voice agent ("Mr. Mwikila") + 4 wired AI-native agents | `packages/ai-copilot/`, `services/api-gateway/src/composition/*-wiring.ts` |
| Audit chain + RLS + field-level encryption | `packages/audit-chain/`, `services/api-gateway/src/middleware/rls.ts` |

## 2. Jurisdictions

Primary jurisdiction is **United Republic of Tanzania**. The platform is also operational in / planned for other East African Community markets.

| Jurisdiction | Status | Primary regulator(s) | Key statute(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tanzania (mainland + Zanzibar) | Live | Bank of Tanzania (BoT — payments hygiene), Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA — landlord tax), NIDA (identity), Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC), TCRA (telecom) | Personal Data Protection Act 2022 (Act No. 11 of 2022); Land (Lease) Regulations; Tax Administration Act; Electronic Transactions Act 2015 |
| Kenya | Live (parallel pack) | Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), ODPC, Capital Markets Authority (CMA — only for REITs / fund-managed portfolios) | Data Protection Act 2019; Landlord & Tenant Acts; ICT Act |
| Uganda | Roadmap | Bank of Uganda, URA, NITA-U | Data Protection and Privacy Act 2019 |
| Rwanda | Roadmap | NBR, RRA | Law on Protection of Personal Data 2021 |

The default deployment for TZ tenants is **Africa-resident where possible**: Supabase Frankfurt (`fra1`) primary with cross-region replicas, transitioning to a Tanzania-resident primary when a SOC-2-attested local provider is available. Cross-border transfers are documented vendor-by-vendor in `09-vendors-and-subprocessors.md`.

## 3. Risk Taxonomy

BossNyumba maintains a single risk register, reviewed quarterly by the Risk & Audit Committee. The categories below are super-set of BoT supervisory categories adapted for a property-tech SaaS.

| **Payments / settlement risk** | Failed STK callback, mis-reconciled rent, double-charge, refund fraud | Idempotent webhooks (`services/payments-ledger/`), reconciliation outbox, four-eyes on refunds |
| **Operational risk** | Outage, vendor failure, human error, on-call gap | BCM/DR (doc 08), circuit breakers, runbooks (`Docs/RUNBOOKS/`) |
| **Cybersecurity / IT risk** | Account takeover, data breach, ransomware, supply-chain compromise | 5-layer defense (doc 02), anomaly detection, hash-chain audit (doc 10) |
| **Privacy / data-protection risk** | Unlawful processing, mishandled DSAR, cross-border transfer | DPIA programme (doc 03), DSAR endpoints (`services/api-gateway/src/routes/gdpr/`), field-level AES-256-GCM |
| **Compliance / legal risk** | Landlord-tax non-disclosure, AML on rent flows, lease-law non-compliance | TRA reporting feeds, AML controls (doc 04), tenancy-law jurisdiction matrix |
| **Conduct / fair-treatment risk** | Discriminatory tenant screening, opaque eviction triggers, rent-pricing bias | Fairness controls (doc 06), human-in-the-loop on eviction-related actions |
| **AI / model risk** | Hallucinated voice-agent answer, drifted pricing model, biased maintenance dispatch | Model Risk Management (doc 05), model cards, kill-switches (`packages/ai-copilot/src/safety/`) |
| **Reputational risk** | Tenant-rights advocacy backlash, regulator action, viral incident | Crisis comms plan (doc 07 §6), media monitoring, transparency reports |
| **Strategic risk** | MNO lock-in, regulatory change, market shift | Multi-MNO aggregator (OLIPA), multi-provider AI orchestration, open-source-first connectors |

## 7. Out of Scope

BossNyumba **does not**:

- Hold customer or tenant deposits, settle payments, or operate any e-money licence
- Lend money on its own balance sheet (no rent-advance, deposit-financing, or working-capital products)
- Provide investment, insurance or securities advice
- Operate any service requiring a banking, microfinance, money-services or insurance licence
- Process biometric or facial-recognition data for any purpose other than tenant KYC liveness initiated by the tenant
- Sell, share or syndicate tenant personal data for marketing purposes

Any expansion beyond this scope requires a board-approved change of business plan and supplementary regulatory engagement.
