## How to Use This Pack

This pack is the canonical evidence bundle for any examination, supervisory visit, or vendor due-diligence review of the BossNyumba property-management platform. Each numbered document is self-contained but cross-references neighbouring docs where useful.

BossNyumba is a **multi-tenant property-management SaaS** operating across East Africa. We are **not a financial institution** — we do not hold deposits, do not lend, and do not act as a payment service provider in our own name. Where we touch money (rent collection via M-Pesa / Airtel Money / GePG / KCB Buni / Pesalink), we do so as a technical conduit and reconciliation layer; the underlying licensed PSPs / banks hold the regulated function. Where we touch sensitive personal data (national IDs, lease terms, biometric KYC, financial standing) we are a **data controller for tenant identity** and a **data processor for property owner data**.

### Recommended reading paths

- **Bank of Tanzania (BoT) / Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) — payments hygiene review:** start with `tz/02` or `ke/02`, then `tz/07` / `ke/07` (incident response) and `tz/08` / `ke/08` (BCM/DR).
- **PDPC (TZ) / ODPC (KE) data-protection audit:** start with `tz/03` or `ke/03`, then `tz/09` / `ke/09` (sub-processors) and `tz/10` / `ke/10` (audit trail).
- **AML / KYC / tenant-identity review:** start with `tz/04` or `ke/04`.
- **AI / model-risk review (where AI is used in pricing, fraud, maintenance prioritisation, voice agent):** start with `tz/05` / `ke/05` and `tz/06` / `ke/06`.
- **Institutional landlord vendor onboarding (NHC, pension funds, DFIs):** start with `tz/01` or `ke/01`, then `09`, `08`, and the public SLA (`Docs/OPERATIONAL_SLA.md`).

Every "our implementation" claim in this pack references a real source-code file path in this monorepo. Examiners may request that the BossNyumba engineering team open any cited file during the review.

Model cards in `tz/model-cards/` and `ke/model-cards/` cover the six AI components most likely to draw regulatory scrutiny: the adaptive UI layout engine (UI-1), the multi-agent debate planner (P-10), the eval-on-traffic online judge (P-9), the constitution-v2 tier-policy resolver (F2), the LATS tree-search planner (F9), and the reflexion + sleep consolidation memory layer (F11).

Kenya-only annex `ke/11-cma-securities-considerations.md` documents the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) position for CMA-regulated institutional landlord clients (REIT managers, pension custodians) and the forward-looking perimeter if BossNyumba ever offers rent-roll-backed financial products.

## Document Maintenance

- Every document is reviewed **annually** by the BossNyumba Compliance Office.
- Any material change to a referenced source file or to a deployed model triggers an out-of-cycle review.
- Examiner or regulator changes to the underlying regulation trigger a within-30-day review.
- Version history is tracked in `git log Docs/regulator-pack/`.

## Cross-reference with COMPLIANCE/

This regulator-pack is **regulator-facing evidence**. The detailed control-level mappings (article-by-article) live in `Docs/COMPLIANCE/` (e.g. `TZ_PDPA_2022.md`, `SOC2_CONTROLS.md`). The regulator-pack documents cite back to `Docs/COMPLIANCE/` and to source code for the authoritative truth.
