# 05 — Model Risk Management (Kenya)

**Document version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-05-22
**Owner:** Model Risk Manager (reports to CRO)
**Jurisdiction:** Kenya
**Frameworks:**
- US Federal Reserve / OCC Supervisory Letter SR 11-7, "Guidance on Model Risk Management" (2011)
- ISO/IEC 23894:2023 — AI risk management
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 (AI RMF)
- EU AI Act (Reg. 2024/1689) — forward-looking reference
- **Kenya DPA 2019 s.35** — right not to be subject to automated decision-making (a binding statutory constraint, distinguishing KE from TZ in this area)
- CBK Cybersecurity Guideline 2017 — model risk treated as operational + cyber sub-category

> SR 11-7 source: `https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1107.htm`. BossNyumba treats this definition expansively to include rule-based decision systems and LLM-driven assistants that influence customer outcomes.

## 1. SR 11-7 — section-by-section mapping

Same structure as TZ pack (see `tz/05-model-risk-management.md` §1). Kenya-specific overlay:

- DPA s.35 right means **every AI-influenced material decision affecting a tenant must support human review on request within 7 days**. This is encoded in the kernel policy at stakes ≥ medium (more conservative than TZ pack's stakes ≥ high).
- ODPC may, on enforcement, require disclosure of model logic — model cards in this pack are pre-prepared for that disclosure.

## 2. Model inventory (current snapshot)

Same inventory as TZ pack (single codebase). Difference: deployment to KE tenants is gated by:

- Region selection at tenant onboarding (KE region = stricter automated-decision policy)
- KES currency rendering throughout
- KE-resident vendor preference where available

| Model ID | Family | Stakes — KE | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `voice-agent-mrmwikila-v1` | LLM | Medium-high | Voice "Mr. Mwikila" — supports Kiswahili + English (KE) + Sheng (lightweight) |
| `monthly-close-orchestrator-v1` | LLM | Medium | KE accounting outputs in iTax format |
| `market-rate-surveillance-v1` | rules + LLM | Medium | Rent reasonableness — informational only |
| `predictive-interventions-v1` | ML | **High** (s.35 review-right invoked at this stakes level) | All KE outputs include "Challenge" CTA |
| `adaptive-layout-engine-v1` | rules + LLM | Low | |
| `three-agent-debate-v1` | LLM ensemble | High | |
| `online-judge-v1` | LLM | Medium | |
| `pii-scrubber-v1` | rules + classifier | High | |
| `tree-of-thoughts-planner-v1` | LLM | Medium-high | |
| `mmr-memory-retriever-v1` | embeddings + rerank | Medium | |

## 3. Model lifecycle

Same as TZ pack. Kenya-specific gates:

- **Approve** stage: where the model processes KE-resident tenant data **and** influences a material decision, ODPC-aware DPIA must be signed by DPO before deploy.
- **Monitor** stage: KE-specific fairness slice (Kiswahili / English / Sheng users; Nairobi / Mombasa / rural; income-source informal / formal).

## 4. AI-specific risks

Same risk inventory as TZ pack. Kenya-specific differences:

| Risk | KE-specific overlay |
|---|---|
| Automated-decision-only (DPA s.35) | Every material decision exposed via "Challenge" button + human review SLA 7 days |
| Bias against informal-economy tenants | High prevalence in KE residential market; quarterly slice audit |
| Voice agent regional dialect coverage | Sheng + coastal Kiswahili tested in adversarial corpus |
| Cross-border LLM inference | Same SCC mechanics, but ODPC may require explicit s.48 notification on enforcement |

## 5. Cross-references

Same model-card references as TZ pack: see `model-cards/adaptive-layout-engine-v1.md`, `three-agent-debate-v1.md`, `online-judge-v1.md`.
