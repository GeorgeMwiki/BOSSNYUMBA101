## 1. Why this annex exists

BossNyumba is **not** a CMA-regulated entity: we do not act as a REIT manager, trustee, fund manager, or any other licensed capital-markets intermediary. We are an operational software platform that property owners — some of whom **are** CMA-regulated — use to manage rental property.

This annex documents (a) the limits of our role, (b) the controls we provide that allow a CMA-regulated landlord to satisfy their outsourcing + disclosure obligations when using BossNyumba, and (c) the forward-looking position should BossNyumba in future enable **rent-roll-backed financial products** (e.g., receivables financing, rent-securitisation, REIT operational outsourcing) at scale, in which case BossNyumba's own regulatory perimeter may shift.

## 2. CMA-regulated client profile

The following client profiles use BossNyumba today or are reasonably foreseeable:

| Client profile | CMA touchpoint | BossNyumba role |
|---|---|---|
| REIT Manager (Income / Development) under CMA Reg. 4 / 5 | Annual filings, periodic reports, disclosures of material developments | Operational software for rent collection, lease lifecycle, tenant communication; produces audit trail + reports |
| Pension-fund custodian (RBA-regulated, holding income real estate) | Custodianship obligations; periodic valuation reports | Same operational role |
| Investment-fund manager (CMA-licensed) holding property in fund portfolio | Fund-rule compliance; investor reporting | Same operational role |
| DFI / multilateral landlord (e.g., Shelter Afrique, IFC affordable-housing portfolio) | DFI-level governance | Same |
| Private REIT in formation (D-REIT) | Pre-listing operational readiness | Same; subject to CMA pre-issuance review |

## 3. Outsourcing position (REIT manager's perspective)

A CMA-licensed REIT manager outsourcing operational property management to BossNyumba must satisfy CMA outsourcing expectations equivalent to CBK/PG/15 (covered in `02-cbk-cybersecurity-mapping.md` Section A). Specifically:

- **Materiality:** rent-collection and tenant-onboarding software is **material** to a REIT's day-to-day operations; institutional landlord clients classify BossNyumba accordingly.
- **Right of audit:** BossNyumba supplies this regulator-pack, SOC 2 Type II attestation (annual), and on-demand examiner access per MSA clause 14.
- **Service-level agreement:** documented in `Docs/OPERATIONAL_SLA.md` and per-client MSA, with KPIs covering uptime, payment-rail availability, audit-trail completeness, and incident response SLAs.
- **Sub-contracting consent:** REIT manager receives 30-day prior notice of any sub-processor change (doc 09 §1).
- **Cross-border data:** disclosed per doc 03 §6.
- **Contingency planning:** exit covered by doc 08 §1 (90-day data export, cryptographic erasure certificate).

## 4. Disclosure-friendly evidence sets

Where a CMA-regulated landlord is preparing an investor disclosure or material-developments filing, BossNyumba can supply structured evidence drawn directly from the audit chain (`packages/database/src/schemas/audit-events.schema.ts`, 120 lines, hash-chained via `packages/ai-copilot/src/security/audit-hash-chain.ts`, 651 lines):

- Rent-collection summary per property / per period
- Vacancy and turnover statistics
- Maintenance-spend and lifecycle history
- Tenant-screening + KYC audit trail (without exposing tenant PII to investor)
- Material-incident log (with PII redacted)
- AI-influenced material decisions affecting tenants (DPA s.35 register; cross-referenced in `06-fairness-and-non-discrimination.md`)

All disclosure packets are produced from immutable hash-chained records (`audit-trail.router.ts` + `admin-audit.router.ts`) and accompanied by a chain-verification report.

## 5. Forward-looking — rent-roll-backed financial products

If BossNyumba in future enables rent-roll-backed financial products (e.g., receivables financing for landlords, rent-tokenisation, lessor-finance underwriting that uses our credit-rating outputs from `packages/ai-copilot/src/credit-rating/` + `packages/central-intelligence/src/credit-scoring/alt-data-credit-model.ts`), the regulatory perimeter materially changes. Specifically:

- Receivables financing may bring BossNyumba within CMA Securities Act if structured as a public offer
- Tokenised rent-roll instruments would engage CMA's digital-asset framework (in development as of 2026)
- Tenant-credit underwriting outputs feeding such products engage both **DPA s.35** (automated decision affecting individuals) and **CMA suitability** (where the credit output is used to set investor-facing terms)

BossNyumba's current position: **no rent-roll-backed financial product is offered or planned for the next 12 months**. Any decision to enable such products requires (a) Board resolution, (b) external counsel opinion, (c) CMA engagement, (d) update of this annex + doc 01 §7 (Out of Scope), (e) DPIA-KE plus s.35 control review.
