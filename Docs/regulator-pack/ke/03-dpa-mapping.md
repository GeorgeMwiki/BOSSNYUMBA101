## 1. Registration (DPA s.18; Reg. 2021)

BossNyumba is registered with the ODPC as:

- **Data Controller** (for tenant identity and tenant communications)
- **Data Processor** (for property-owner data processed on their behalf)

> TODO: insert ODPC registration certificate number + renewal date.

DPO appointment notified to ODPC per DPA s.24 + Reg. 6 of Compliance and Enforcement Regulations.

## 2. Lawful basis (DPA s.30)

BossNyumba processes personal data on the following lawful bases:

| Processing | Lawful basis | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tenant onboarding (KYC: IPRS lookup, ID OCR, liveness) | Consent + legitimate interest of landlord | Consent captured at signup |
| Rent collection + reconciliation | Contract performance (lease) | |
| Lease lifecycle | Contract performance | |
| Maintenance request handling | Contract performance + legitimate interest | |
| Owner / investor portfolio dashboards | Legitimate interest of property owner | Balancing test documented |
| Voice agent recordings | Explicit consent | Bilingual sw/en |
| Marketing communications | Consent (opt-in) | Withdrawable |
| Audit log | Legal obligation (tax, accounting) | |

Full register at `Docs/COMPLIANCE/lawful-basis-register.json`.

## 3. Principles (DPA s.25)

Identical to TZ-PDPA Article 5 principles (see `tz/03-pdpa-mapping.md` §1). DPA s.25 enumerates: lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose-limitation, data-minimisation, accuracy, storage-limitation, integrity-confidentiality, accountability.

## 4. Data subject rights (DPA s.26)

| Right | DPA reference | How exercised | SLA |
|---|---|---|---|
| Information (privacy notice) | s.29 | Privacy notice at signup; layered | Immediate |
| Access | s.26(a) | Self-serve "Export my data" | < 30 days |
| Rectification | s.26(b) | Self-serve profile edit | Immediate (self-serve) |
| Erasure | s.26(c) | Self-serve "Delete my account" → 30-day grace → crypto erasure | < 30 days |
| Restriction | s.26(d) | DPO-routed | < 7 days |
| Object | s.26(e) | DPO-routed | < 7 days |
| Portability | s.34 | JSON / CSV bundle | < 30 days |
| Not be subject to automated decision (s.35) | s.35 | Right to human review on any AI-influenced material decision (see doc 06 §4) | < 7 days |

DPA s.35 specifically grants the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing. BossNyumba implements this via the "Challenge a decision" button on any AI-influenced notice + human-in-the-loop on eviction-related, fairness-flagged or stakes-high actions.

## 5. Sensitive personal data (DPA s.44)

DPA s.44 identifies sensitive personal data (race, health, ethnic-social origin, conscience, belief, genetic, biometric, property details, marital status, family details, sex / sexual orientation). Several of these intersect property management directly.

**BossNyumba handling:**

- **Biometric data (face liveness for KYC):** processed by Smile Identity; explicit consent; hash + match score retained (not raw image); 7-year retention.
- **Property details:** core to the lease purpose; processed under contract.
- **Marital status:** collected only when required by lease (e.g., joint tenancy); never used for AI-influenced decision features (see doc 06).
- **Family details:** collected only where required (e.g., dependents on a residential lease); access scoped + audit-logged.
- **Health data:** **NOT processed**.
- **Ethnic-social origin / belief / sexual orientation:** **prohibited inputs**; AI safety layer rejects.

## 6. Cross-border transfer (DPA s.48–s.50)

DPA s.48 prohibits cross-border transfer unless: (a) adequate safeguards (SCCs / BCRs), (b) consent, (c) necessary for contract, (d) public interest, (e) data subject's vital interest, (f) compelling legitimate interests, or (g) ODPC's notification regime.

**BossNyumba compliance:**

- Current cross-border transfers are to **EU-resident** providers (Supabase fra1, Vercel fra1) — EU adequacy generally accepted.
- US transfers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Twilio, Smile Identity) rely on EU SCCs + DPA-Kenya-specific addenda.
- Tenant consent captured at signup with explicit mention of cross-border transfer.
- ODPC notification per s.48(4): in preparation. See `Docs/COMPLIANCE/cross-border-transfer-policy.md`.

## 7. Breach notification (DPA s.43)

DPA s.43: notification to ODPC within 72 hours of becoming aware of a breach likely to result in risk to data-subject rights. Affected data subjects to be notified without undue delay.

**BossNyumba internal target: 24 h from confirmation.** See doc 07 §5.

## 8. DPIAs (DPA s.31)

Same DPIA programme as TZ pack (see `tz/03-pdpa-mapping.md` §6). DPIAs registered with ODPC where required by Reg. 2021.

| DPIA-ID | Processing | Risk score | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| DPIA-KE-001 | Tenant identity onboarding (IPRS + liveness) | Medium-high | TODO — DPO sign-off pending |
| DPIA-KE-002 | Voice agent — tenant call recording + STT | Medium-high | TODO — DPO sign-off pending |
| DPIA-KE-003 | Predictive interventions agent (cross-ref with DPA s.35 right) | High | TODO — DPO sign-off + fairness review |
| DPIA-KE-004 | Adaptive layout engine | Low-medium | TODO — DPO sign-off pending |

## 9. ODPC enforcement (DPA Part X)

ODPC has enforcement powers including penalty notices up to KES 5,000,000 or 1% of annual turnover, whichever lower (DPA s.63). BossNyumba controls:

- Field-level encryption, RLS, RBAC, AI safety layer (preventing unlawful processing)
- DPO + CCO four-eyes on ODPC responses
- 24-h SLA for ODPC enquiries

> TODO: insert ODPC contact card + escalation matrix.
