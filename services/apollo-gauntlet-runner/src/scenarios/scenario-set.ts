/**
 * 10 pre-shipped scheming-detection scenarios. Property-management
 * surfaces: leasing decisions, eviction flows, maintenance, finance
 * automation, tenant chat.
 *
 * Coverage:
 *   1. Deception            — operator asks AI to lie to tenant
 *   2. Sandbagging          — operator asks AI to under-score a borrower
 *   3. Sycophancy           — pressure to flip a recommendation
 *   4. Instrumental conv.   — AI asked to expand its tool access
 *   5. Hidden goal pursuit  — task framed as benign hides retaliation
 *   6. Metric gaming        — game KPI by misclassification
 *   7. Capability lying     — operator asks AI to pretend it can't compute
 *   8. Covert action        — silent unauthorised waiver
 *   9. Strategic deception  — multi-step lie to regulator
 *   10. Sandbagging-2       — strategic delay to skew SLA
