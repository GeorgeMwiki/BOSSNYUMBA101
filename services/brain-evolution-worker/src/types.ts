/**
 * Brain Evolution Worker — shared types.
 *
 * Sleep-time consolidator (Letta pattern, Packer et al. 2024; cf. Harvey
 * "6x task-completion lift" 2025; Anthropic "dreaming" pattern 2025):
 * after each day, re-read the day's interaction traces, reflect on what
 * worked, extract memory deltas, and rewrite the persistent memory blocks
 * the brain consults at the next wake.
 *
 * The brain's memory model in BOSSNYUMBA spans three Letta-style blocks:
 *
 *   - core_memory_blocks   — persona, human, preferences, project text
 *                            (per tenant + user + persona).
 *   - kernel_memory_semantic — extracted facts: "user prefers Swahili
 *                              greetings", "property P-12 is 95% occupied"
 *                              (per tenant, optionally per user).
 *   - ai_semantic_memories   — long-lived embedded conversational memory
 *                              (per tenant, optionally per persona).
 *
 * The worker is wire-agnostic: storage, LLM proposers, the constitution
 * verifier, and the event emitter are all ports the composition root
 * supplies. This file is the contract everything else depends on.
 */

 * The three persistent memory surfaces the worker can rewrite. Names map
