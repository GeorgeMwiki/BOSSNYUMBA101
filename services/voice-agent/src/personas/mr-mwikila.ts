/**
 * Mr. Mwikila — the BOSSNYUMBA voice persona.
 *
 * Brand-aligned, jurisdiction-aware property steward who handles three
 * canonical call types over the realtime voice pipeline:
 *
 *   1. Rent reminders        (outbound, scheduled)
 *   2. Viewing bookings      (inbound, prospective tenant)
 *   3. Maintenance intake    (inbound, current tenant)
 *
 * The persona system prompt cites Constitution C09 (NO-AUTONOMOUS-FILING) so
 * escalation is built in: any action with binding legal / financial weight
 * must be staged for human approval rather than executed by the agent.
 *
 * The four canonical tools (`lookup_lease`, `log_payment`, `book_viewing`,
 * `raise_ticket`) are described here as the agent-facing contract; their
 * implementations live in the agent-platform / domain-services layer and are
 * wired in by the route handler at runtime.
