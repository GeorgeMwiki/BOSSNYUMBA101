/**
 * Kill-switch middleware — closes a multi-way valve on the platform's
 * highest-risk irreversible mutations:
 *
 *   - eviction                 → POST /leases/:id/terminate
 *   - payment-reversal         → POST /payments + POST /payments/:id/process
 *   - account-deletion         → POST /gdpr/delete-request + .../execute
 *   - refund                   → POST /move-out/:leaseId/finalize
 *   - data-export              → GET  /dsar/:subjectId/export
 *   - monthly-close-reverse    → POST /monthly-close/trigger
 *   - sublease-cancel          → POST /sublease/:id/revoke
 *   - sovereign-ledger-override → POST /admin/sovereign-ledger/verify
 *
 * Surfaced in `.audit/deep-audit-2026-05-20.md`: the feature-flags service
 * was wired into `c.get('services').featureFlags` but no route group was
 * actually consulting it. A single misconfigured deploy, ABAC bug, or
 * compromised admin session could fire one of these endpoints with no
 * blast-radius cap. This middleware closes that gap.
 *
 * Design:
 *
 *   1. Each guarded operation maps to a snake_case feature-flag key
 *      (the service validator enforces `/^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$/` — `:` and `-`
 *      are rejected). Flags default OFF (FALSE) — the migration seeds them
 *      so they show up in operator listings.
 *
 *   2. When a flag is ON for the caller's tenant, the middleware short-
 *      circuits with a structured 503 envelope so callers (UI, integrations)
 *      can distinguish "policy fired" from "service down". Audit log is
 *      written before the response so operators always see who tripped
 *      the wire.
 *
 *   3. When the flag is OFF (or unknown — service returns FALSE), the
 *      middleware passes through. Unknown-flag is treated as "safe" rather
 *      than "fail closed" because the seed migration may not yet have
 *      run in a sandbox; production deploys see seeded values.
 *
 *   4. The feature-flags service is read off `c.get('services').featureFlags`
 *      — the canonical accessor wired by `service-context.middleware.ts`.
 *      When the registry is in degraded mode (no DB) the accessor is null
 *      and the guard passes through (no flag → no kill).
 *
 *   5. Flag-lookup ERRORS fail CLOSED in production (DA1 HIGH finding):
 *      a DB outage, RLS denial, or transient network blip MUST NOT silently
 *      bypass the kill-switch on irreversible ops. Production returns
 *      503 `KILL_SWITCH_LOOKUP_FAILED`. Dev/test keep fail-open with a
 *      structured WARN so local-loop iteration stays fast.
 *
 * Tests in `__tests__/kill-switch.middleware.test.ts`:
 *   - flag OFF  → next() called, handler runs, 200
 *   - flag ON   → 503 with `KILL_SWITCH_ACTIVE`, audit emitted
 *   - svc null  → pass-through (degraded mode)
 *   - lookup throws + prod → 503 KILL_SWITCH_LOOKUP_FAILED
 *   - lookup throws + dev  → pass-through + WARN
