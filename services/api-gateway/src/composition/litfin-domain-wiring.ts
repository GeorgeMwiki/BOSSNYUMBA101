/**
 * LITFIN-port domain composition helper (Batch 2).
 *
 * Wires 5 domain-shaped packages onto `ServiceRegistry`:
 *
 *   - `@bossnyumba/mcp-cost-persistence` (PO-37): per-MCP cost +
 *     health probe scheduling — pure kernels + injectable sinks.
 *     Exposed as DI namespace (no I/O at construction time).
 *   - `@bossnyumba/fairness-eval`: counterfactual fairness eval
 *     with Fair Housing Act + TZ/KE attribute registries. Exposed
 *     as DI namespace; consumers (eval workers, governance audit)
 *     instantiate `createFairnessEval({ brain, jurisdiction })`
 *     when needed (brain port only resolvable per-tenant at runtime).
 *   - `@bossnyumba/analytics`: Cube semantic + Vega-Lite v6 +
 *     AI chart authoring. `createAnalytics` is wired with no brain
 *     or realtime port today (both follow-ups); the parsers /
 *     dashboards / chart-builder pure functions remain reachable
 *     via the namespace export.
 *   - `@bossnyumba/knowledge-graph`: real-estate ontology +
 *     GraphRAG + viz spec builders. In-memory store + mock
 *     embedder for now; production swap is a Neo4j adapter +
 *     OpenAI text embedder (both ports already exposed).
 *   - `@bossnyumba/compliance-pack`: 10-framework controls + DSAR
 *     automation + erasure cascade + envelope encryption +
 *     residency policy + breach notification. The `engine` slot
 *     stays null because collectors + residency policy are per-
 *     tenant; consumers call `createComplianceEngine` themselves
 *     with the tenant-scoped deps. Pure-function surfaces
 *     (control catalogs, cascade builder, residency checker,
 *     breach helpers) remain reachable via the namespace export.
