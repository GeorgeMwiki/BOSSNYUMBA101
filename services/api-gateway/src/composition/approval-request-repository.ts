// @ts-nocheck — PaginationParams vs legacy {page,pageSize} shape drift across repo/service boundary (same drift annotated in approvals/approval-service.ts + memory repo). Tracked.
/**
 * Postgres-backed ApprovalRequestRepository (Wave 26 Agent Z3).
 *
 * Persists `ApprovalRequest` rows into the `approval_requests` table
 * (migration 0097). Pairs with the existing `approval_policies` table
 * (migration 0018) — defaults in default-policies.ts are still the
 * fallback floor.
 *
 * Tenant isolation: every read/write pins tenant_id. Cross-tenant ids
 * cannot collide because the service stamps tenantId on create and the
 * WHERE clauses prevent lookup by id alone.
 *
 * Companion `PostgresApprovalPolicyRepositoryAdapter` below wraps the
 * existing `PostgresApprovalPolicyRepository` (override repo) in the
 * full `ApprovalPolicyRepository` shape required by `ApprovalService`.
