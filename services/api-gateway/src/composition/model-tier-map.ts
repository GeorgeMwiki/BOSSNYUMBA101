/**
 * Intelligence-Elasticity — the composition-root tier→model-id map.
 *
 * THE one place gateway composition resolves a concrete model id from a
 * capability tier (`'cheap' | 'standard' | 'deep'`). No wiring file may
 * pin a literal model id (every literal is a RESISTOR) — swapping the
 * brain to a smarter model is ONE change against this resolution:
 *
 *   1. `BOSSNYUMBA_MODEL_TIER_<CHEAP|STANDARD|DEEP>` env — explicit
 *      operator pin per tier (wins outright).
 *   2. dynamic model registry `getModelLatest(family)` — L1 TTL cache →
 *      L2 live `/v1/models` → L3 baselines. The L3 baselines (operator-
 *      overridable via `BOSSNYUMBA_MODEL_BASELINE_<FAMILY>`) default to
 *      EXACTLY the ids the wiring files shipped with, so runtime
 *      behavior is unchanged until the registry/env says otherwise.
 *
 * Resolution is PER-CALL (the `critics/haiku-critic.ts` precedent),
 * never frozen at module load, so registry freshness + env-map changes
 * apply without touching call-site code.
 *
 * Tier→family policy mirrors `selectModelTier` in
 * `@bossnyumba/central-intelligence/kernel/model-tiering`:
 * cheap=Haiku-class, standard=Sonnet-class, deep=Opus/Fable-class.
 *
 * THE COMPOUNDING-GROWTH CARVE-OUT (NON-NEGOTIABLE). Any core path that makes
 * the system GROW — identify/cover unknown-unknowns, self-improve, learn, the
 * apex organs (dynamic topology, uplift detection, eval-gated autonomy,
 * blindspot-coverage, crystallization ratchet, retrospective self-eval),
 * meta-learning, the sentinel lattice — MUST resolve to tier `'deep'` (the
 * rank-front Anthropic model, Fable today) and MUST NEVER be cost-downgraded.
 * The cost-aware downshift (`selectModelTier` fast-lane → cheap,
 * `BOSSNYUMBA_MODEL_TIERING`) applies to ORDINARY work ONLY — never the growth
 * core. Rationale: intelligence is CAPITAL there, not cost — the frontier
 * model does the growth/design work, it CRYSTALLIZES into the substrate, and
 * cheaper models inherit the upgraded substrate elsewhere. Compounding
 * capability growth is core; do not play with it. This is the DEFAULT — the
 * owner may override the growth-core's default model per-tenant/vertical via
 * the internal admin governance platform (a deliberate, audited setting);
 * absent that explicit override it is always the rank-front Anthropic model.
 * When the multi-provider best-of-bracket router lands, the growth-critical
 * resolver is a hard guard that bypasses cost policy and stays Anthropic
 * rank-front unless the governance override is set.
