/**
 * The self-healing report sink — INTERNAL-ADMIN / platform-scoped, never the
 * owner. Every blocker the MAPE-K loop processes (auto-healed observation OR
 * human-gated escalation) is a BossNyumba engineering signal; the owner runs
 * their estate and must never see or approve the platform healing its own
 * wiring.
 *
 * Two effects, both fail-safe:
 *   1. A structured `audience: 'internal-admin'` log line (admin observability).
 *   2. Fire-and-forget PERSISTENCE to the `self_healing_proposals` queue (the
 *      admin console) — via a store the composition root REGISTERS at boot.
 *      Until registered (or with no DB), the sink is log-only; it never throws
 *      and never blocks the heal loop it serves.
 *
 * Shared by the composition root (read-path seam), the router (resolver
 * unmapped-binding seam), and the genui-telemetry beacon (projector
 * unknown-kind seam) — a standalone module so none of them import each other.
