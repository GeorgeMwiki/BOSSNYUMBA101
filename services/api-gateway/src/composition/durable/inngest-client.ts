/**
 * inngest-client — factory for the Inngest client used by the
 * production durable-execution backend.
 *
 * Why a factory and not a top-level singleton?
 *
 *   1. The api-gateway must boot WITHOUT Inngest in dev / CI (no
 *      `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY`). The factory is invoked lazily by the
 *      composition root so test environments never construct a real
 *      Inngest connection.
 *   2. Composition root decides whether to route through Inngest or
 *      fall back to the in-process custom checkpoint runner (see
 *      `durable-runner.ts`). The decision lives at one site — env
 *      gate inside `createInngestClient`.
 *   3. Tests can pass `{ id }` only and a stub `send()` to validate
 *      the wiring without a real network call.
 *
 * Production wire-up:
 *
 *   - `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` must be set. When missing, the factory
 *     returns `null` and the durable-runner stays on its custom
 *     checkpoint backend (this is the safe default for CI / local).
 *   - `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` (Inngest webhook signature) is consumed
 *     by the webhook router — not this factory — but we surface a
 *     helper here so call sites have a single import.
 *   - The app id is fixed: `bossnyumba-api-gateway`. Changing it
 *     would orphan in-flight Inngest runs, so it is deliberately
 *     hard-coded.
 *
 * NB: this module is INTENTIONALLY a thin wrapper. Most of the
 * Inngest contract is enforced inside the function definitions
 * (`./inngest-functions/`) where step.run() boundaries live.
