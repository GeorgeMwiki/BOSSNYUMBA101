/**
 * agency-run.fn — Inngest function wrapping the existing durable
 * step-by-step executor.
 *
 * The function definition is API-COMPATIBLE with our current
 * `runStep` semantics in `durable-runner.ts`: each `step.run()` call
 * is automatically checkpointed by Inngest, results survive process
 * crashes, and retries are governed by Inngest's per-function policy.
 *
 * Why a separate file instead of inlining inside durable-runner?
 *
 *   1. The runner has two backends (Inngest + custom checkpoint).
 *      Keeping Inngest's specifics out of the runner core lets us
 *      delete this file the day we go 100% Inngest without churning
 *      the runner.
 *   2. Inngest's `createFunction` signature is verbose; pulling it
 *      into its own module keeps the runner readable.
 *   3. Tests for the function builder live alongside it — no
 *      cross-cutting test surface in the runner suite.
 *
 * Production wiring:
 *
 *   - The function is registered with the Inngest dev server (or
 *     Inngest cloud) at app boot via the webhook router's `serve()`.
 *   - The function receives the event payload, walks the goal's
 *     steps, and invokes `executeStep` for each — exactly what the
 *     custom runner does today.
 *   - On any step throw, Inngest's default retry policy applies:
 *     4 attempts with exponential backoff. This MATCHES the runner's
 *     `[200, 400, 800]ms` schedule closely (Inngest is `[1s, 4s,
 *     16s, 1m]` — we accept the longer tail because Inngest gets
 *     real distributed durability in exchange).
 *
 * Test note: the actual `inngest` package's `createFunction` is
 * loaded dynamically — when absent (CI baseline), the factory
 * returns `null` and the runner sticks to its custom backend.
