/**
 * Counter-model production wiring — Central Command Phase B (B5).
 *
 * Builds a `CounterModel` adapter bound to the api-gateway's wrapped
 * Anthropic client (circuit-breaker + budget-guard already applied at
 * the composition root). The kernel's executor consumes the resulting
 * port through its optional `counterModel` dep — when this factory
 * returns null (no Anthropic client configured) the executor simply
 * skips the second-LLM check and falls back to the legacy approval
 * flow.
 *
 * Coordination with B2 (composition/sovereign.ts owner):
 *   - sovereign.ts already constructs the wrapped Anthropic client
 *     into `anthropic` (after `wrapAnthropicWithCircuitBreaker`). The
 *     wire-in is ONE line inside `createExecutor({...})`:
 *
 *         counterModel: createProductionCounterModel(anthropic),
 *
 *   - Do that for BOTH executor instances (the early `agencyExecutor`
 *     stubbed branch + the `realAgencyExecutor` Drizzle-bound branch)
 *     so the counter-model fires regardless of which branch wins for
 *     the current request.
