/**
 * Cockpit Event Bus — in-process, tenant-scoped pub/sub for the
 * cockpit SSE channel.
 *
 * Why in-process and not Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY?
 *   - BossNyumba api-gateway runs single-node in MVP; horizontal scale
 *     comes later. An in-process EventEmitter is O(subscribers) per
 *     publish, has zero infrastructure dependencies, and is trivially
 *     testable.
 *   - When we shard, this module is the only seam to swap for a
 *     PG-LISTEN / Redis-pubsub fan-out. The publisher / subscriber
 *     API stays identical; the bus is the only thing that changes.
 *
 * Tenant isolation:
 *   Subscribers register per-tenantId; the bus NEVER cross-broadcasts
 *   between tenants. publish() with the wrong tenant simply finds no
 *   subscribers (it does not throw).
 *
 * Backpressure:
 *   The bus is fire-and-forget — handlers must not block the publisher.
 *   The SSE route handler queues events in its own bounded array and
 *   drops the oldest if the client cannot keep up; the bus itself does
 *   not buffer.
 *
 * Memory safety:
 *   Subscribers MUST call the returned `unsubscribe()` on close or
 *   the bus will retain references indefinitely. The SSE handler
 *   wires this to the request abort signal.
