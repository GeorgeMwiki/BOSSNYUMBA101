 * Wave ARTIFACT-RICHNESS-2026-05-29. Every BossNyumba artifact (drafts,
 * briefs, scan reports, decision-journal entries, inspection
 * narratives, compliance exports, plan-DAGs, blackboards, settlement
 * statements, RFB confirmations, cockpit cards, audit receipts) flows
 * its source-of-truth markdown through this layer to gain SOTA
 * richness without each producer re-implementing mermaid / KaTeX /
 * citation embed / branded layout / TOC / empty-state behaviour.
 *
 * The package is consumed:
 *   - by `services/api-gateway/src/services/document-drafter/renderers/*`
 *     to extend the markdown-to-html pipeline.
 *   - by every artifact-producing service that wants its body to look
 *     like the others (single visual contract).
 *
 * Zero direct dependency on heavy libs — mermaid / KaTeX / vega are
 * imported lazily so cold-start stays cheap and the api-gateway boots
 * in environments where those binaries are absent. Each renderer
 * gracefully degrades to the textual source when its peer is missing.
