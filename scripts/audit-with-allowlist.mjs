/**
 * Wrapper around `pnpm audit --json` that allows a documented allowlist
 * of accepted-risk advisories. Exits 0 only when EVERY high+ advisory
 * is in the allowlist; otherwise exits 1 with a structured failure
 * report so operators can see exactly which advisory needs action.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/audit-with-allowlist.mjs
 *
 * The allowlist below covers two categories:
 *   1. Unfixable: the upstream patched version does not exist on npm
 *      (e.g. lodash >=4.18.0 — latest published is 4.17.21).
 *   2. Major-version breaking change deferred to its own PR
 *      (e.g. drizzle-orm 0.36 → 0.45).
 *
 * Each entry includes `reason`, `tracked_in`, and `next_review` so the
 * accept-decision is auditable. The CI fails fast if a NEW advisory
 * appears outside the allowlist.

  // wave-L audit (W4, 2026-05-17): re-verified all three vega mitigations.

  //      ZERO hits outside this file — VEGA_DEBUG is never set anywhere
  //      in app code, environment files, or runtime config.
  //   2. ajv compiles a Vega-Lite structural schema and validates EVERY
  //      spec before render in both the server-side render-block
  //      (packages/central-intelligence/src/kernel/tools/render-blocks/
  //      validate.ts:27-31) and the client-side consumer
  //      (apps/admin-platform-portal/src/lib/genui/validate.ts:82-89 +
  //      VegaChart.tsx:55-63, which refuses to render unless ajvOk.ok).
  //   3. No `setdata` invocations exist in genui/ or render-blocks/ —
  //      VegaChart uses the declarative `data: { values: props.data }`
  //      injection pattern; setdata is never called client-side with
  //      user-controlled data. The Vega runtime's internal setdata runs
  //      only against server-emitted, ajv-validated payloads.
