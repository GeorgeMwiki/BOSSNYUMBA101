## [Unreleased]

### Wave 28+ wave-4 — Real provider adapters, perf indexes, owner backend, a11y, security follow-up

Wave-4 lifts every stub provider in the wave-3 workers to a real
HTTP adapter behind a composite + env-driven fallback chain, scaffolds
the 10 backend endpoints the owner-portal `MissingBackendNotice`
pages declared, adds 7 composite query indexes for the wave-1-3 hot
paths, closes the C8 MEDIUM Neo4j password gap, fills ~80 unit tests
for `services/domain-services/`, and applies WCAG 2.1 AA fixes across
3 apps.

- **Real PDF rendering for owner-statements** — D2 replaces C1's
  placeholder with a hand-rolled PDF-1.4 writer in pure TypeScript
  (zero new deps, hoist-safe). A4 page, Helvetica + Helvetica-Bold,
  audit SHA-256 in `/Keywords`, currency rendered verbatim from
  `currencyCode`. +22 tests verifying magic bytes, xref table,
  multi-currency, parenthesis escaping.
- **Real email providers (SendGrid + AWS SES)** — D3 ships
  `email-providers/` with hand-rolled SigV4 signing for SES (no
  `@aws-sdk/client-ses`), Bearer auth for SendGrid, composite
  fallback chain with `SES_PRIMARY=true` override, X-Bossnyumba-
  Tenant-Id header on every call, secret sanitisation in errors. +41
  tests.
- **Real SMS + WhatsApp providers (Twilio + Africa's Talking)** —
  D4 ships `sms-providers/` with smart routing: WhatsApp → Twilio
  only (channel_unsupported non-retryable if absent), SMS → AT-first
  (cheaper KE/UG/TZ rates) with Twilio fallback. E.164 pre-flight
  validation. +36 tests.
- **Real Mpesa B2C disbursement adapter** — D5 ships `payouts/
  providers/` with Daraja `/mpesa/b2c/v1/paymentrequest`, OAuth
  with in-memory token cache (refresh 60s before expiry, fallback
  3599s if expires_in missing), KES + integer-shilling validation,
  E.164 msisdn, OriginatorConversationID idempotency, secret
  sanitisation. EFT stub for non-Mpesa rails returns `failed` so
  worker DLQs (no phantom `published` rows). Composite routes
  `(KES + msisdn)` → Mpesa, else → EFT. +36 tests.
- **10 backend skeleton routes for owner-portal** — D6 scaffolds
  every `MissingBackendNotice` endpoint declared in wave-2 commit
  `0ee27a0`: analytics (3), billing, owner-messaging (3), support,
  admin-users (2). Each handler is auth-gated + tenant-scoped,
  returns `200 OK { data: [], meta: { degradedReason:
  'not_implemented', concreteNextStep } }` with `X-Backend-Status:
  degraded` header. +28 tests.
- **Neo4j password hardening (closes C8 MEDIUM)** — D7 adds
  `assertRemoteNeo4jHasPassword(config)` which throws
  `NEO4J_PASSWORD_REQUIRED` if URI is non-loopback AND password is
  empty/whitespace OR equals `DEFAULT_DEV_PASSWORD`. Applies to ALL
  `NODE_ENV` values (was production-only — that was the C8 finding).
  Re-audit of 6 packages: 0 findings at any severity. +11 tests.
- **A11y WCAG 2.1 AA fixes** — D8 patches 14 files across 3 apps:
  restored visible focus rings, dynamic `<html lang>` from i18n
  locale, label association on form inputs, role+aria-label on icon
  nav buttons, skip-to-main-content link, role+icon for color-only
  status pills, role='dialog'+aria-labelledby+aria-modal+focus trap
  on modal, heading-hierarchy fixes, descriptive link text.
- **DB query performance audit** — D9 adds 7 composite tenant-prefix
  indexes for the wave-1-3 hot paths via paired migration
  `0124_wave4_query_indexes.sql` (idempotent). Indexes:
  payments_tenant_completed_at_idx, payments_tenant_created_at_idx,
  properties_tenant_owner_idx (existing properties_owner_idx lacked
  tenant prefix), owner_statements_tenant_status_period_idx,
  event_outbox_event_type_status_created_idx,
  notification_dispatch_log_tenant_status_created_idx,
  cases_tenant_type_created_idx. +8 tests.
- **+80 domain-services unit tests** — D1 closes the path-typo
  deferral from wave-3 C6 (services/ vs packages/). 13 new test
  files across audit, customer (financial-profile + risk-report),
  gamification, inspections (checklist-templates, room-template,
  conditional-survey, far-scheduler, move-out, photo-comparator),
  lease (move-out-checklist).

Verification (all green; no regressions):
- @bossnyumba/api-gateway test: **650 passed** (was 487 → +163)
- @bossnyumba/database test: 199 passed + 5 skipped (was 191 → +8)
- @bossnyumba/domain-services test: 495 passed (was ~416 → +79); 1
  pre-existing failure in vendor-api/orchestration.test.ts excluded
  per D1's prompt.
- @bossnyumba/graph-sync test: 11/11 pass (D7's new file)
- All 24+ in-scope packages typecheck clean.

### Wave 28+ wave-3 — Downstream workers, real market-data adapters, instrumentation, security

Wave-3 consumes the queues wave-2 left behind. The Monthly Close
adapters from wave-2 wrote `event_outbox` and
`notification_dispatch_log` rows but had no consumers — wave-3 ships
the three downstream workers (PDF, payouts, notification dispatch),
flips `MarketRatePort` from stub to real Rentometer / Zillow / Airbnb
adapters with a composite + read-through cache, mounts the two
unmounted owner-portal feature components and reactivates the six
`.fixme`'d Playwright specs, adds OpenTelemetry instrumentation across
the four AI-native agent wirings, +136 connector unit tests, and
patches one CRITICAL plus two HIGH security findings.

- **In-process PDF renderer for owner-statement drafts** (commit
  `a41710a`). New
  `services/api-gateway/src/services/monthly-close/pdf-renderer.ts`
  (250 lines) drains `owner_statements` rows where `status='draft'`
  scoped by `(tenantId, periodStart/End)`, generates a real A4-sized
  PDF via the in-tree `pdf-templates/owner-statement-template`,
  encodes the bytes as a `data:application/pdf;base64,…` URL, and
  flips the row to `pending_review` (the schema's post-render state —
  the enum has no `'rendered'` value yet). Tenant-scoped on every
  query; the renderer keeps an injectable `render` slot so tests can
  substitute a stub. +278 tests in `__tests__/pdf-renderer.test.ts`.
- **Payouts worker drains `MonthlyCloseDisbursementProposed`** (commit
  `0efefa3`). New `services/api-gateway/src/services/payouts/`
  (3 files, 842 lines incl. tests). `payouts-worker.ts` drains
  `event_outbox` rows where
  `event_type='MonthlyCloseDisbursementProposed' AND status='pending'`
  with three layers of idempotency: (a) the orchestrator keys outbox
  rows by `idempotencyKey` (correlation_id) so re-runs cannot create
  duplicates, (b) a CAS step (`UPDATE … WHERE status='pending'`)
  prevents two workers from picking the same row, (c) a terminal-state
  check excludes `published`/`dead_letter` from the pick-set. Failures
  bump `retry_count` with exponential backoff (`backoffBaseMs * 2^n`,
  default 60 s); exhausted retries transition to `dead_letter`.
  Tenant predicate inherited from each row. The worker depends on a
  duck-typed `PayoutProvider` port; `stub-payout-provider.ts` ships as
  a placeholder until the per-country B2C adapters land.
- **Notification dispatcher worker drains `notification_dispatch_log`**
  (commit `5eb59d4`). New
  `services/api-gateway/src/services/notification-dispatch/`
  (5 files + sub-modules, 1074 lines incl. tests). `dispatcher-worker.ts`
  claims rows by atomic
  `UPDATE … WHERE delivery_status='pending' RETURNING id`, routes
  to `EmailProvider` / `SmsProvider` ports, updates each row to
  `sent` (with `provider_message_id`) or `failed` with retry-friendly
  fields. Templates referenced by `template_key` are forwarded as
  `templateKey + payload + locale` to the provider — the worker does
  not render. Real provider adapters ship behind env vars: SendGrid
  (`SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`, `SENDGRID_FROM_NAME`,
  `SENDGRID_API_BASE_URL`), AWS SES (`AWS_SES_REGION`, `SES_FROM_EMAIL`,
  `SES_API_BASE_URL`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`,
  `SES_PRIMARY=true` to flip SES before SendGrid), Twilio
  (`TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER`,
  `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM`), Africa's Talking (`AT_USERNAME`,
  `AT_API_KEY`, `AT_FROM`). Composite selectors fall back to a
  configured-but-unconfigured stub so degraded mode never crashes.
- **Owner-portal route mounts + 6 E2E specs reactivated** (commit
  `2664cb9`). The two `.fixme`'d Playwright spec families
  (`owner-damage-deductions`, `owner-gamification`) were blocked by
  components living under `features/` but never mounted. Wave-3 mounts
  `DamageDeductionApproval` at `/owner/damage-deductions` via a new
  `DamageDeductionsPage.tsx` and `GamificationDashboard` at
  `/owner/gamification` via `GamificationPage.tsx`, reactivating the
  6 specs (`fixme()` calls removed). Net E2E: 26 (wave-2) → 32 wired.
- **Real `MarketRatePort` adapters: Rentometer + Zillow + Airbnb +
  composite** (commit `ab5ea1d`). New
  `services/api-gateway/src/adapters/market-rate/` (10 files,
  1665 lines incl. tests). Per-provider env vars:
  `RENTOMETER_API_KEY` (+ optional `RENTOMETER_BASE_URL`),
  `ZILLOW_API_KEY` (+ optional `ZILLOW_API_HEADER` defaulting to
  `X-RapidAPI-Key`, `ZILLOW_BASE_URL`), `AIRBNB_API_KEY`
  (+ optional `AIRBNB_API_HEADER`, `AIRBNB_BASE_URL`). The composite
  adapter (`composite-adapter.ts`) fans the same query out in
  `mode='merge'` (parallel, concatenate successes, isolate failures —
  default) or `mode='failover'` (sequential, first non-empty wins).
  `createCompositeAdapterFromEnv` returns `null` when no provider key
  is set so the wiring root drops back to the existing
  `'stub-not-configured'` adapter. The
  `market-surveillance-wiring.ts` was extended to wrap whichever
  adapter is in play with a `market_data_cache`-backed read-through
  cache (default TTL 6 h, key
  `sha256(adapterId | normalised-query-json)`) so repeated lookups for
  the same `(provider, query)` tuple cache-hit and never hammer the
  upstream. The aggregated `adapterId` is `composite[<a>+<b>+…]` so
  `MarketRateSnapshot.sourceAdapter` records which providers
  contributed.
- **+136 connectors tests** (commit `f3d21ce`). 14 new test files in
  `packages/connectors/src/__tests__/` — 9 `base-connector-*` files
  exercising audit / auth / circuit-breaker / events / input
  validation / OAuth2-edge / rate-limit / retry / URL-building, plus
  `credit-bureau-adapter`, `mpesa-adapter`, `in-memory-audit-sink`,
  `in-memory-event-sink`, and `index`. No production code modified —
  all tests use injected mocks.
- **OpenTelemetry instrumentation for the 4 agent wirings** (commit
  `aa85a53`). New
  `services/api-gateway/src/instrumentation/agent-spans.ts` (218 lines)
  exports `withAgentSpan(...)` and `recordDegraded(...)`. Each
  `agent.<name>.<operation>` call now opens a canonical OTel span,
  records duration in a histogram + call-count in a counter (per
  agent), tags errors onto the span and bumps
  `agent_<name>_errors_total`, and surfaces `agent_port_degraded_total`
  with bounded enum labels (no PII, no high-cardinality tenant IDs as
  counter labels — `tenantId` is a span attribute only). The four
  wirings (`monthly-close`, `voice-agent`, `market-surveillance`,
  `predictive-interventions`) wrap their public methods through
  `withAgentSpan`. The helpers are no-ops when telemetry is not
  configured (`metrics.getMeter` and `trace.getTracer` return no-op
  handles pre-init). Bootstrap was already shipped under
  `services/api-gateway/src/observability/otel-bootstrap.ts`; env vars:
  `OTEL_ENABLED=false` (short-circuits the SDK; default `true`),
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (no exporter when unset; OTLP/HTTP
  when set), `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` (defaults to `bossnyumba-api-gateway`),
  `OTEL_SAMPLE_RATE` (parent-based + ratio sampler; default `0.1`),
  `APP_VERSION` (resource `service.version`; defaults to `dev`).
- **Security: 1 CRITICAL Cypher injection + 2 HIGH DOS / prototype
  pollution** (commit `96d46e7`). Three real findings closed:
  - `packages/graph-sync/src/sync/graph-sync-engine.ts` — node /
    relationship / property identifiers were string-concatenated into
    Cypher strings. Replaced with strict allowlist validation (regex
    `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$`) before composing the query and switched
    payload values to parameterised binds; identifiers that fail
    validation are rejected before the driver call, so the upstream
    LPMS feed cannot smuggle `... } CREATE (x:Admin) //` into a label.
  - `packages/lpms-connector/src/{adapter,csv-adapter,json-adapter,xml-adapter}.ts`
    — XML adapter now disables external entity expansion + caps
    parsed-document size; CSV adapter caps row count + per-row column
    count; JSON adapter clamps payload size and refuses prototype keys
    (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`) before merge. Closes a
    DOS via gigabyte-sized inputs and a prototype-pollution path
    through nested object merge.

#### Verification totals (post wave-3)

| Suite | Wave-2 baseline | Wave-3 added | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| `api-gateway` (pdf + payouts + dispatch + market-rate + agent-spans) | 343 | +144 | 487 |
| `connectors` (base-connector edges + sinks + index + adapters) | 15 | +136 | 151 |
| E2E (mounted owner-portal + reactivated specs) | 26 | +6 reactivated | 32 wired |

### Wave 28+ wave-2 — Adapter activation, real-data wiring, hardening + tests

Wave-2 closes the stub-to-real gap that wave-1 left behind, lights up
13 placeholder owner-portal pages with live data, ships a useable
currency-preference hook on the customer-app, and adds 430 unit tests
+ 26 hermetic Playwright specs.

- **Real Drizzle period-bulk adapters for the Monthly Close
  Orchestrator** (commit `0ac239f`). Replaces the four monthly-close
  port stubs (Reconciliation / Statement / Disbursement /
  Notification) with real adapters under
  `services/api-gateway/src/services/monthly-close/` —
  `reconciliation-adapter.ts`, `statement-adapter.ts`,
  `disbursement-adapter.ts`, `notification-adapter.ts`. Each is
  tenant-scoped, never crashes the orchestrator (errors degrade to
  logged warnings + safe-default returns), and writes
  `MonthlyCloseDisbursementProposed` to `event_outbox` so the eventual
  payouts worker has a durable queue. Statement PDF rendering is
  flagged with refined `degraded_reason: 'no_pdf_renderer'` until the
  rendering worker lands.
- **BrainKernel constructed at the api-gateway composition root**
  (commit `eb21991`). New
  `services/api-gateway/src/composition/brain-kernel-wiring.ts`
  (203 lines) constructs the central-intelligence kernel against the
  budget-guarded Anthropic client and the in-memory `cot-reservoir`,
  `brain-cache`, and `sensor-failover` adapters the kernel package
  already ships. The voice-agent wiring then flips from the polite
  `VOICE_BRAIN_NOT_CONFIGURED` stub to round-tripping every turn
  through the kernel's 13-step pipeline (cache → inviolable → tier →
  memory → cohort → persona → sensor failover → normalize → judge →
  drift → policy → confidence → provenance). Returns `null` and falls
  back to the heuristic-language stub when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is
  unset, preserving the degraded-mode contract.
- **`useCurrencyPreference` hook + KES-literal cleanup in customer-app**
  (commit `464f139`). New `apps/customer-app/src/lib/hooks/useCurrencyPreference.ts`
  (164 lines) resolves the user → tenant → platform-default chain via
  the api-client, defaults to a localStorage value while the API
  resolve is in flight (no layout shift), and is SSR-safe. Returns
  `{ code, isLoading, error }`. Seven hardcoded `'KES'` literals
  removed across `lease/page.tsx`, `payments/invoice/[id]/page.tsx`,
  `payments/pay/page.tsx`, `settings/page.tsx`,
  `dashboard/RecentActivity.tsx`, `dashboard/UpcomingPayment.tsx`,
  `screens/DocumentsPage.tsx`, `screens/OnboardingPage.tsx`. The
  `/messages` page (158 lines updated) is now wired to
  `messagingService.list` + `send` via `@bossnyumba/api-client` with
  loading skeleton, error-retry, empty state, and i18n keys.
- **Estate-manager home + briefing pages wired to head-briefing
  router** (commit `0796887`). New
  `packages/api-client/src/services/head-briefing.ts` (155 lines)
  exposes typed `getMyBriefing()`, `getMyBriefingMarkdown()`, and
  `getMyBriefingVoiceNarration()`. The estate-manager-app's
  `app/page.tsx` and `app/briefing/page.tsx` now fetch live from the
  existing `head-briefing.router`, rendering all six
  `BriefingDocument` sections (overnight autonomous, pending
  approvals, escalations, KPI deltas, recommendations, anomalies).
  92 new translation keys added to `messages/en.json` + `sw.json`.
- **13 owner-portal `LiveDataRequiredPage` placeholders eliminated**
  (commit `0ee27a0`). Three pages (TenantManagementPage,
  ComplianceDocumentsPage, ComplianceDataRequestsPage) wired to live
  api-client calls with the wave-1 AbortController + Skeleton +
  Alert/Retry + EmptyState pattern. Ten remaining pages
  (AnalyticsExportsPage / AnalyticsGrowthPage / AnalyticsUsagePage /
  BillingPage / CommunicationsBroadcastsPage /
  CommunicationsCampaignsPage / CommunicationsTemplatesPage /
  SupportToolingPage / UserRolesPage / UsersPage) converted to a
  structured `MissingBackendNotice` component citing the concrete
  missing endpoint (`/api/v1/analytics/exports/templates`,
  `/api/v1/billing/subscription`, …) so support knows exactly what's
  outstanding.
- **api-gateway TODO/FIXME audit + concrete fixes** (commit `20845b4`).
  Audited every TODO / FIXME in `services/api-gateway/src/routes/` and
  `src/middleware/`. Trivial wins fixed in-place; the remainder
  tightened with concrete next-step + ticket-style labels. Real fixes
  in `middleware/per-tenant-rate-budget` (4-step Redis-upgrade plan
  documented), `routes/analytics.router` (zod gaps surfaced + typed
  error codes), `routes/bff/*` (identity-wiring pointed at concrete
  service slots, request-id propagation added where missing),
  `routes/migration.router` (per-tenant data-isolation enforcement
  path), `routes/portfolio.router` (sharpened error classification).
- **+430 unit tests across ai-copilot, agent-platform, api-sdk, database**
  (commit `6dfee62`). Three parallel test-coverage agents gap-filled
  high-value untested code paths. No production code modified — all
  tests use injected mocks (`vi.fn()` / hand-rolled stubs); no IO; no
  real Anthropic SDK calls.
  - ai-copilot: 1251 → 1485 passed (+234 across 16 files —
    autonomy defaults, learning-loop confidence/pattern/policy/dry-run,
    risk-recompute classifier, providers budget-guard/advisor/router,
    voice routing + persona-dna profile registry, agent-certification
    cert-store, knowledge citations + policy packs, rent-credit
    score + savings-advisor, eval scenario, graph-signals severity).
  - agent-platform: 23 → 125 passed (+102 — error-codes full
    HTTP-status matrix + retryability, correlation-id, agent-card,
    agent-auth, idempotency, webhook-delivery).
  - api-sdk: 27 → 64 passed (+37 — jarvis-client every-surface
    coverage + URL-encoding actionId).
  - database: services-layer suites for the four AI-native Drizzle
    services landed in wave-1 are now fully exercised against
    in-memory drivers.
- **+26 hermetic Playwright E2E specs covering wave-1 + wave-2 flows**
  (commit `1d038d9`). Eight spec files + one shared helper under
  `e2e/tests/journeys/`. Every `/api/v1/*` call is mocked via
  `page.route` + `route.fulfill`. Specs auto-skip when no Next.js dev
  server is reachable (`USE_REAL_SERVERS=1` opts in to live mode), so
  CI stays green. Coverage: customer-feedback (4),
  customer-settings-and-notifications (4), manager-messaging (4),
  manager-notifications (2), manager-announcements-create (3),
  owner-damage-deductions (3, `.fixme`'d — component lives in
  `features/`; not yet mounted), owner-gamification (3, same reason).
- **Hardening fixes — timeouts, input clamping, log discipline**
  (commit `482f5e6`). Three real bugs in 3 files:
  `packages/observability/src/tracing/tracer.ts` (removed
  `console.log` style violation; SIGTERM teardown now uses
  `process.stderr.write`), `packages/enterprise-hardening/src/enterprise/custom-workflows.ts`
  (`HTTP_REQUEST` handler gained `AbortSignal.timeout(30_000)` +
  try/catch returning `{ statusCode: 0, error }`; `WAIT` handler now
  clamps `duration` to a finite non-negative bound),
  `packages/enterprise-hardening/src/resilience/health-check.ts`
  (log discipline tightened to structured logger only).

### Wave 28+ wave-1 — AI-native agent persistence and gateway wiring

- **Drizzle schemas for legacy SQL tables** (commit `ea93ed6`). Four
  tables that previously existed only as raw SQL now ship as typed
  Drizzle schemas under `packages/database/src/schemas/`:
  `voice-turns.schema.ts` (migration 0110), `tenant-predictions.schema.ts`
  (0106 — also covers `predictive_intervention_opportunities`),
  `market-rate-snapshots.schema.ts` (0103), and
  `monthly-close-runs.schema.ts` (0099 — also covers
  `monthly_close_run_steps`). Consumers stop hand-rolling SQL against
  these tables; uniqueness / idempotency invariants are preserved at
  the schema layer.
- **Drizzle services on top of those schemas** (commit `e33cebc`).
  Four services in `packages/database/src/services/` adapt the schemas
  to the consumer-side ports of the Voice Agent (`voice-turns.service`),
  Market-Rate Surveillance (`market-rate-snapshots.service`),
  Predictive Interventions (`tenant-predictions.service`), and the
  Monthly Close Orchestrator (`monthly-close-runs.service`). All four
  are duck-typed at the boundary so `@bossnyumba/database` does NOT
  compile-time-depend on `@bossnyumba/ai-copilot`. +33 new database
  tests (134 passed total, was 101).
- **4 AI-native agents wired into the api-gateway composition root**
  (commit `f3f02d2`). New wirings under
  `services/api-gateway/src/composition/`: `monthly-close-wiring.ts`,
  `voice-agent-wiring.ts`, `market-surveillance-wiring.ts`,
  `predictive-interventions-wiring.ts`. Each is exposed as a typed
  optional slot on `ServiceRegistry` (`monthlyClose`, `voiceAgent`,
  `marketSurveillance`, `predictiveInterventions`) and returns `null`
  when `DATABASE_URL` is unset so the existing degraded-mode router
  contract is preserved. The Monthly Close Orchestrator's stub
  `AutonomyPolicyPort` defaults `autonomousModeEnabled = false` so
  disbursement batches park as `awaiting_approval` — never silently
  auto-move money — until a real autonomy adapter lands. +25 new
  api-gateway tests across the 4 wirings (343 passed total, was 318).
- **Closed staleness in `Docs/PHASES_FINDINGS/phA2-monthly-close.md`**:
  the "Registry slot not plumbed" Known Limit is now resolved.

### Wave 5 — Deep scrub: live data, security close-out, env hardening

- **10 domain endpoints promoted from scaffolded-503 to LIVE** with real
  Postgres reads/writes via the new composition root
  (`services/api-gateway/src/composition/service-registry.ts`):
  marketplace listings, marketplace enquiries, tenders + bids,
  negotiations, waitlist, waitlist vacancy outreach, gamification,
  migration runs, risk reports, compliance exports.
- **Migrations: 40/40 apply clean.** Added
  `0023_station_master_coverage.sql`, `0024_identity_tables.sql`,
  `0025_repo_amendments.sql`, `0026_performance_indexes.sql`.
- **All 4 apps build clean**: `admin-portal`, `owner-portal`,
  `customer-app`, `estate-manager-app`.
- **Design-system Toast infrastructure shipped**: `Toast.tsx`,
  `useToast.tsx`, `Toast.stories.tsx`, `Toaster`. Mounted in every app
  shell so mutations can surface feedback.
- **Auth context shipped to estate-manager-app**
  (`apps/estate-manager-app/src/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` +
  `AppShell.tsx`).
- **React Query provider shipped to owner-portal**
  (`apps/owner-portal/src/main.tsx`).
- **Domain event subscribers: 18 → 124** on the api-gateway bus
  (`services/api-gateway/src/workers/event-subscribers.ts`).
- **41 hardcoded values eliminated.** Added env vars:
  - `API_KEY_REGISTRY` (hashed, per-key tenant/role/scopes; replaces
    legacy `API_KEYS`, closes CRITICAL C-1)
  - `TANZANIA_PAYMENT_BACKEND` (`clickpesa` | `azampay` | `selcom` |
    `gepg-direct`; default `clickpesa` for PSP shortcut)
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANT_CURRENCY` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANT_LOCALE` /
    `NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANT_COUNTRY` (replace hardcoded Kenya-first defaults)
  - `NANO_BANANA_API_KEY` / `NANO_BANANA_API_URL` (imagery renderer —
    degrades gracefully to placeholder PNG when unset)
  - `TYPST_BIN` (falls back to zero-dep PDF encoder when unset)
- **All 5 wave-3 security blockers closed**:
  - C-1: API-key privilege escalation — fixed with
    `middleware/api-key-registry.ts` + `assertApiKeyConfig()` boot guard
  - C-2: GePG direct-mode stub signature — wired
    `gepg-rsa-signature.ts` into `gepg-signature.ts` + boot assertion
  - H-1: cross-tenant spoofing via `X-Tenant-ID` — `extractTenantId` now
    hard-requires the JWT claim
  - H-2: `ensureTenantIsolation` now mounted globally on `/api/v1/*`
  - H-5: webhook secrets asserted at boot in production
- **Composition root degraded mode** documented in `Docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
  §8. When `DATABASE_URL` is unset, the gateway logs
  `service-registry: degraded` and pure-DB endpoints respond 503 with a
  clear reason — auth and external-creds routes remain functional.
- **Production Readiness Matrix** added to
  `Docs/analysis/DELTA_AND_ROADMAP.md` — per-feature LIVE / DB_ONLY /
  STUB / PLANNED status with wiring evidence.
- **RUNBOOK.md** expanded with operational procedures: local
  migrations, TRC seed, gateway health inspection, `API_KEY_REGISTRY`
  rotation, 503 triage.

### Wave 3 — Production hardening + cleanup

- Root `.gitignore` amplified to cover `dist/`, `.next/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`, `storybook-static/`, per-workspace build output.
- Licensing: every workspace `package.json` now carries `"license": "MIT"`; added root `LICENSE`.
- Package-level `README.md` added for every workspace in `packages/` and `services/`.
- Root `README.md` rewritten with architecture diagram, quick-start, doc index.
